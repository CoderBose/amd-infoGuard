DeSantis said public schools were religious when U.S. began. Is he right?,"April 30, 2024",Jeffrey S. Solochek,"Education, Religion, Florida","Before signing into law a measure allowing religious chaplains in public schools,  Gov. Ron DeSantis said the initiative brought Florida closer to what the nation's  founders wanted for educating youth. ""When education in the United States first started, every school was a religious  school. That was just part of it. Public schools were religious schools,"" DeSantis said  at an April 18 news conference. ""There’s been things that have been done over the years that veered away from that original intent,"" he continued, ""but the reality is I think what we are doing is really restoring the sense of purpose that our Founding Fathers wanted to see in education."" Education historians said the notion that the founders intended for a religion-based  public schooling system is an increasingly common misconception. It's gained traction amid high-profile incidents including a taxpayer-funded church-sponsored charter school in Oklahoma, a lawsuit over whether public high school coaches can pray at games in Washington, and now this provision for chaplains in Florida schools. The reality is not so simple, they said. The founders did not establish a public education system, which really didn't get started for another 50 or so years. And when public schools began, they did not employ chaplains. That does not, however, mean religion was absent from early schooling. ""The answer is, perhaps expectedly, nuanced and hard to capture in a single sentence,"" said F. Chris Curran, director of the Education Research Policy Center at  the University of Florida. Schooling began in the colonies before the founding of the nation, and much of it was closely tied to religion, Curran said by email. ""An act passed in Massachusetts in 1647, ‘Old Deluder Satan Act,’ is often cited as  the first public education in what would become the US,"" Curran wrote. ""Requiring  communities across the state to hire teachers, the general purpose of the act was to  ensure a level of literacy sufficient for reading the Bible and preventing individuals from falling prey to 'the old deluder, Satan.’"" Schooling was not organized at that time, though. Most children did not have access  to education beyond what their parents could provide, which ranged from private tutoring to boarding schools, according to a history of public education by Bellwether. By the time of the American Revolution, some Northeast towns had free local schools paid for by residents, ""but this was not the norm,"" according to a frequently cited history from the Center on Education Policy, a nonpartisan group that researches and analyzes education issues. As leaders crafted the Declaration of Independence and, later, the Constitution, many had strong views about the importance of schooling and the role of religion in it. ""Some Founding Fathers, such as Benjamin Rush, really did want public schools to teach children how to be better evangelical Protestant Christians,"" said Adam Laats, professor of education and history at Binghamton University, part of the State University of New York system. ""But others, like Thomas Jefferson, thought public schools had to remove all religious ideas entirely."" Several advocated for a formal education system, Laats said. Jefferson and others contended that the fledgling nation would depend on an educated populace that understood their roles as citizens in a democracy. But universal public education didn't emerge at that time, and the founders did not establish guidance on the matter, as Laats wrote in a column for The Washington Post. Despite their interest in the subject, the founders ""had nothing to say about public  education"" in the documents establishing the nation, said Sevan Terzian, professor of social foundations of education in UF's School of Teaching & Learning. ""Public education didn't really start until the 1830s,"" Terzian said. That's when Horace Mann, secretary of the Massachusetts board of education, came  up with the ""common school"" concept that is associated with the system the nation now has. ""By the mid-1800s, most states had accepted three basic assumptions governing  public education: that schools should be free and supported by taxes, that teachers should be trained, and that children should be required to attend school,"" Wendy A. Paterson, dean of the Buffalo University School of Education, wrote in an article for the school's 150th anniversary. Those earliest schools paid for withpublic funds ""were not religious schools, although most schools opened with prayers or Bible reading,"" education historian Diane Ravitch, founder of the Network for Public Education, said via email. ""But such activities were incidental, not the purpose of the schools."" The common schools, though, sought to provide a unified sense of moral values to connect citizens, and those generally aligned with the majority Protestant Christian values of the time, Terzian said: ""For most of the 19th century, most of public education was implicitly Protestant Christian, and some of it was explicit."" That caused denominational rivalries, which led to the establishment of private religious schools. Catholic leaders complained that public schools used a Protestant Bible, Ravitch said, ""and there were violent clashes between the two major religious groups. Catholics, mostly Irish and recent immigrants, determined to build their own school  system, where only Catholic materials would be used."" The focus of public education shifted as the nation's economy diversified, along with  its demographics, Terzian said. ""Schools became places for preparing youth or the  transition into a growing industrial economy,"" he explained. Still, prayer remained common. Officials aimed to have prayer general enough that  most could agree on it regardless of their denomination, Laats said. With the number of non-Christian religions in the nation increasing, views on that emphasis changed over time, too. ""Eventually, the rhetorical commitment to nonsectarianism was fulfilled, much to the displeasure of those who had wished to support a national religion,"" said Jack Schneider, an education professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In the 1960s, the U.S. Supreme Court made clear in rulings that when allowing religious aspects into schools, government should not be viewed as endorsing it, Laats said. Since then, he added, Americans’ views have solidified around the free practice of religion. Even if prayer is allowed, or a religious organization is permitted in a school, the same opportunities exist for all students without giving preferences. For instance, if a group like the Fellowship of Christian Athletes is permitted to meet, so, too, are other clubs and organizations with religious affiliations. Laats suggested that DeSantis might be testing that perspective by stating that theSatanic Temple, which has shown interest in participating in the chaplain program, is not a real religion and would not be included. The future of religion — and chaplains — in the public schools might still be evolving, a question for the courts to decide. But historians say the truth of the past is that public schools were not established as religious by the founders. Jeffrey S. Solochek is the Tampa Bay Times’ education reporter."
Are there really Chinese sleeper cells operating in the U.S.?,"April 29, 2024",Conor Amendola,"China, Homeland Security, Terrorism, New York","Is the Chinese Communist Party operating ""sleeper cells"" on American soil? That’s what Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said in a recent social media post. Stefanik, who as House Republican Conference chair is the third-highest party official under Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., decried Chinese nationals crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in a March 17 post on X. Stefanik, who has closely aligned herself with former President Donald Trump, went on to say in the post that ""we know the #CCP (the Chinese Communist Party) has set up sleeper cells in our communities. Joe Biden is asleep at the wheel as a hostile foreign regime is waging war on our way of life."" Over 20,000 Communist Chinese nationals have illegally crossed the Southern Border since October and we know the #CCP has set up sleeper cells in our communities.Joe Biden is asleep at the wheel as a hostile foreign regime is waging war on our way of life. PolitiFact reached out to Stefanik — a member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence committees — multiple times but never received a response. However, terrorism experts said whether her assertion is accurate depends on how one defines ""sleeper cell."" We couldn’t find any publicly available, official intelligence community definition of ""sleeper cell,"" and we did not hear back from the CIA or the House Intelligence Committee. But the International Spy Museum, which has board members and advisers from the intelligence community, defines a ""sleeper agent"" as an ""agent living as an ordinary citizen in a foreign country; acts only when a hostile situation develops."" This definition mirrors the image most Americans may have from pop culture: spies or terrorists who embed themselves in another country. These so-called sleeper agents pass themselves off as ordinary citizens as they await a call from their handlers — sometimes years later — with orders to undertake a mission such as sabotage or terrorism. Experts told PolitiFact they are unaware of any efforts by China or its ruling Communist Party that fit this Hollywood version of a sleeper cell. However, a looser definition of ""sleeper cell"" may fit a recent case of Chinese nationals who allegedly embedded themselves in Manhattan to operate an ""illegal overseas police station,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert who founded the security and technology firm Valens Global. According to the Justice Department’s April 2023 announcement of the charges, the effort was focused on intimidating Chinese dissidents. Like sleeper agents, the suspects worked undercover within an American community while doing the bidding of a foreign government. But the case also presents differences with the popular conception of sleeper cells. The suspects allegedly targeted Chinese dissidents living in America, not native-born Americans; their endgame does not appear to have been a terrorist act against the U.S.; and the suspects’ anti-dissident operations may have been ongoing, rather than having to await orders for a specific mission. The existence of these overseas police stations had been bubbling up for a few years prior to the arrests. In September 2022, a Spanish human rights group, Safeguard Defenders, released a report alleging the existence of at least 54 secret Chinese police stations in 21 countries. In April 2023, U.S. media reports cited seven Chinese police stations in the U.S.: two in New York City, two in California, one in Minnesota, one in Nebraska and one in Texas. That month, the U.S. arrested ""Harry"" Lu Jianwang, 61, of the Bronx, and Chen Jinping, 59, of Manhattan, on charges related to operating a Chinese police station in lower Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood on behalf of a provincial branch of China’s Ministry of Public Security. The suspects were charged with ""conspiring to act as agents of the (People’s Republic of China’s) government as well as obstructing justice by destroying evidence of their communications with"" a Ministry of Public Security official, the Justice Department said in announcing the arrests. ""They were residents of New York City, they communicated with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, they worked to establish this unofficial police station, they operated it clandestinely at the behest of the People’s Republic of China, and it involved at least two people, which is the minimum for a ‘cell,’"" said Gartenstein-Ross, the terrorism expert. ""That provides a number of aspects that would establish them as a sleeper cell."" The Chinese ""police stations"" don’t fit other aspects of the popularly held definition To the extent ordinary Americans have heard of sleeper cells, however, it’s from pop culture — and such examples differ from the Chinese police stations. The Chinese defendants don’t appear to have been terrorists, unlike the sleeper cells from the 2005-2006 Showtime miniseries ""Sleeper Cell"" or another Showtime series, ""Homeland."" In addition, the Chinese defendants appear to have been targeting Chinese dissidents, rather than natives of the country in which they embedded themselves. The latter was the modus operandi in the 1962 movie ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and the 2013-2018 FX series ""The Americans."" It also appears that the two men arrested were pursuing their activities on an ongoing basis, rather than waiting for years to undertake a specific mission, which is a key element of the Spy Museum definition. Experts told PolitiFact that a Chinese-devised sleeper cell of the Hollywood variety seems far-fetched in today’s environment. They said Stefanik’s framing falls into the longstanding trope of a feared Chinese invasion. ""Stefanik is basically replicating old-school ‘red scare’ stuff, trying to provoke anti-China sentiment,"" said James J.F. Forest, the director of security studies at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell. However, they added, other tactics seem more promising from the Chinese perspective. ""A cyber-attack involving hackers that are already present and lurking in our networks is far more likely than a Chinese-directed terrorist campaign involving ‘sleeper cells,’"" Forest said. ""That’s not what China does, nor is it something they’d want or need to do."" Suzanne Ogden, a professor emerita of political science at Northwestern University, agreed. Ogden said China has ""so many thousands of students in scholars and others in this country that they don’t really need so-called sleeper cells. In the age of computers, they can find out everything they want to know without doing what sleeper cells used to do."""
Here’s how new Title IX regulations could affect LGBTQ+ students,"April 26, 2024",Grace Abels,"Education, LGBTQ","After the nation’s leading gender equity law, Title IX, received a long-anticipated update, the reviews are in — and they’re as mixed as a can of machine-shaken paint at Sherwin-WIlliams. Civil rights advocates at the Southern Poverty Law Center praised the revisions as ""bolstering protections for LGBTQ+ students."" Meanwhile, one sexual violence researcher said the new regulations ""abandoned"" trans athletes. And Riley Gaines, an athlete who opposes transgender athletes’ participation in women’s sports, said the changes ""officially abolished Title IX as we knew it.""

Some states, including Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma and South Carolina have directed schools to ignore the policy’s directives. ""We will not comply,"" Florida’s Gov. Ron DeSantis said April 25. Title IX, enacted in 1972, prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded schools. The law applies to admissions, classrooms, and protecting students against sexual harassment, but it is most well-known for how it changed athletics by requiring that women and men be provided equitable opportunities to participate. The most recent changes came in response to President Joe Biden’s 2021 request that the Department of Education review its regulations for enforcing Title IX following Trump administration-era changes and a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that updates the understanding of ""sex discrimination"" to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. After two years and 240,000 public comments, the Education Department released its updated ""Final Title IX Regulations"" April 19. The new ""rule"" made changes to several policies around sexual misconduct investigations, such as expanding the definition of sexual harassment. But much of the attention has focused on how this will affect LGBTQ+ students. Despite the recent controversy over transgender athletes and Title IX’s strong association with athletics, the changes stopped short of providing guidance on transgender athletes in this set of regulations. The new regulations expand Title IX protections to LGBTQ+ students in line with the landmark 2020 Supreme Court decision, Bostock v. Clayton County. Weighing a series of cases in which employees said they were fired for being gay or transgender, the court in Bostock held that terminating people for their sexual orientation or gender identity amounts to ""sex discrimination"" prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. ""It is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex,"" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the majority opinion. That a woman being attracted to men is tolerated, for example, when a man being attracted to men is not, he said, shows such discrimination. Since Bostock, legal advocates and the Biden administration have argued that the same reasoning must be applied to other laws that prohibit ""sex discrimination,"" such as the Fair Housing Act, Immigration and Nationality Act, and Title IX. The 2024 regulations essentially do that and now consider discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation to fall under Title IX. The regulations take effect Aug. 1. LGBTQ+ students will now be able to turn to Title IX protections when they feel they have been discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. ""You're not going to be dismissed because you don't have standing under the statute to bring the argument,"" Ohio State University law professor Ruth Colker said.

For example, a student losing a part in a school play after a teacher finds out the student is gay could qualify as a discrimination claim investigated under Title IX under the law’s revision. ""Things that had previously been protected only by interpretive guidance are now protected by force of regulation,"" said Helen Drew, a sports law professor at the University at Buffalo. 

But the question gets more complicated when considering local or state laws that are potentially discriminatory. Policies such as transgender ""bathroom bans"" are likely to be in the ""crosshairs,"" Drew said. Such laws will likely face lawsuits over whether they constitute sex discrimination. States may make arguments about privacy or other rationales for a given policy, Colker said, ""And the question will be, does that rationale survive scrutiny under the federal statute?"" ""I think we're setting up a Supreme Court case,"" Drew said. A Department of Education spokesperson told PolitiFact that state or local law does not supersede Title IX compliance. Still, some state leaders issued statements advising schools to not alter any policy and suggested plans to challenge the regulations in court. Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters presides meeting discuss to the U.S. Department of Education's ""Proposed Change to its Title IX Regulations on Students' Eligibility for Athletic Teams,"" April 12, 2023 (AP) The department can theoretically revoke federal funding for schools that don’t comply with Title IX, Drew said, but the agency has never used that power. Drew likened it to having an atomic bomb: The federal agency has the power to use it, but it is ""very unlikely"" that they are ""going to drop it,"" she said. Essentially, no. Although the Education Department is working separately to address the issue. In recent years, 24 states passed laws governing the eligibility of transgender students who wish to participate in school sports. Those restrictions — often focused on limiting the eligibility of transgender girls to play on women’s teams — have sparked political debate, litigation and misinformation. Yet this recent Title IX revision does not decide the controversial issue of transgender girls and athletic eligibility. The Education Department released a fact sheet alongside the new regulations that said that although generally preventing someone from participating in school activities consistent with their gender identity causes them ""harm,"" that principle has exceptions, including ""sex-separate athletic teams."" The fact sheet also clarifies that the new regulations ""do not include new rules governing eligibility criteria for athletic teams."" The Education Department is working separately on a proposal, introduced in April 2023, that would ban schools from adopting ""one-size-fits-all"" policies that ban transgender students from participating on teams consistent with their gender identity. In the April 19 press release, the department clarified that the ""rulemaking process is still ongoing"" for the regulation regarding athletics, but that the high number of public comments (150,000) "" by law must be carefully considered."""
Donald Trump exagera la disminución del crimen en Venezuela y engaña sobre sus causas,"April 24, 2024",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"Immigration, Crime, PolitiFact en Español","En sus mítines de campaña, el expresidente Donald Trump usualmente repite una declaración imprecisa, infundada: Países mundialmente están vaciando sus prisiones e instituciones mentales y enviando a esas personas como migrantes a los Estados Unidos. La forma en que se dijo la declaración y los países incluidos han cambiado, pero varias organizaciones de noticias han verificado diferentes iteraciones y han llegado a la misma conclusión: No hay evidencia de que países están vaciando sus prisiones o instituciones mentales para enviar personas a los Estados Unidos. Trump recientemente citó la disminución del crimen en Venezuela como evidencia de este fenómeno. ""El crimen bajó un 67% en Venezuela porque están tomando sus bandas y sus criminales y depositándolos tranquilamente en los Estados Unidos"", dijo Trump el 2 de abril en un mitin en Green Bay, Wisconsin. Ese día temprano, en Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump repitió la cifra, diciendo que el crimen en Venezuela había disminuido tanto en el último año y medio. ""¿No nos encantaría tener una estadística en donde el crimen haya bajado un 67%? El nuestro solo está yendo en una dirección"", dijo él, señalando hacia arriba. En general, los crímenes violentos y homicidios han disminuido bajo la presidencia de Joe Biden. Los homicidios también han disminuido en Venezuela pero no por un 67% o por una migración criminal masiva a los Estados Unidos, dijeron criminalistas del país. Es difícil rastrear las estadísticas de crimen en Venezuela porque el gobierno no publica datos confiables, dijo Mike LaSusa, director adjunto de contenido en InSight Crime, una organización enfocada en crimen y seguridad en las Américas. EFE, una agencia de noticias, reportó que el gobierno de Venezuela no ha publicado las cifras de asesinatos o robos en 10 años. Trump no proporcionó evidencia a PolitiFact de que el crimen de Venezuela disminuyó un 67% y no clarificó a qué tipo de crimen se estaba refiriendo. Pero LaSusa dijo que los datos disponibles no respaldan la declaración de Trump. ""Evaluaciones independientes, incluyendo nuestras propias observaciones, no respaldan la idea de que la delincuencia haya disminuido un 67%"", dijo LaSusa. LaSusa también refirió una conferencia de prensa reciente durante la cual el funcionario de seguridad venezolana, Remigio Ceballos Ichaso, dijo que el crimen ha disminuido un 32% en 2024, comparado con 2023. La declaración de prensa del Ministro de Relaciones Interiores, Justicia y Paz  de Venezuela no especificó qué tipo de crimen incluía esa cifra. Datos del Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia, una organización sin fines de lucro independiente de Venezuela, en la cual LaSusa confía, tampoco respalda la declaración de Trump. No ha habido una disminución de 67% en los años pasados, dijo a PolitiFact desde Venezuela, el fundador y director del grupo, Roberto Briceño León. Las cifras del Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia muestran una disminución de un 25% en muertes violentas desde 2022 a 2023, incluyendo homicidios, muertes por intervención policial y muertes bajo investigación. A pesar de esa disminución, el Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia nota que la tasa sigue siendo alta comparada con otros países en la región. En 2023, Venezuela tenía la tasa de 26.8 muertes violentas por 100,000 personas, según el Observatorio Venezolano de Violencia. México tuvo una tasa de 12 homicidios por 100,000 personas en la primera mitad de 2023, según el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía. Estados Unidos, en 2022, tenía una tasa de 6.8 homicidios por 100,000 personas. Por años, Venezuela ha enfrentado una crisis humanitaria con una economía en rápido declive. El país ha experimentado hiperinflación, escasez de comida, medicinas y abusos de los derechos humanos. Como resultado, más de 7.7 millones de personas han huido de Venezuela según las Naciones Unidas desde el 2014. La mayoría han emigrado a Colombia, Perú, Ecuador y Chile, reportaron grupos de derechos humanos de Amnistía Internacional. Briceño León dijo que el crimen en Venezuela ha estado disminuyendo por años, pero no es porque el gobierno de Venezuela está enviando criminales a los Estados Unidos. ""La criminalidad bajó, se redujo porque se perdieron las oportunidades del crimen para el delito. Es decir, la pobreza generalizada en el país, la ausencia de dinero circulante, la reducción del quiebre de las empresas, del comercio hizo que se redujera las oportunidades que el crimen podía tener en el país"", le dijo Briceño León a PolitiFact. ""Cuando se reducen las oportunidades del crimen, los criminales, bueno, no tienen a quien robar… no tienen a quien extorsionar"". Los crímenes violentos también han disminuido porque hay muchas personas que han dejado el país, pero eso no sustancia la declaración de Trump de que los criminales de las prisiones de Venezuela, se están reubicando en ciudades de Estados Unidos. Un profesor de criminología de la Universidad Central de Venezuela Luis Izquiel, dijo que muchas personas que viven en áreas pobres y rurales y que a menudo eran víctimas de crímenes dejaron el país. Las personas que cometían los crímenes también se fueron, en parte porque tenían menos oportunidades para cometer crímenes, dijo Izquiel. La migración de millones de jóvenes también ha cambiado la naturaleza del crimen en Venezuela, dijo Briceño León. Bandas de vecindarios pequeños se han desvanecido ya que los jóvenes se han ido y las grandes organizaciones criminales han consolidado el poder. ""El delito también disminuye porque hay más crimen organizado en el país y el crimen organizado actúa racionalmente frente a la violencia"", dijo Briceño León. Así que hay una disminución en la letalidad. Por ejemplo, jóvenes en pequeñas bandas pueden haberse matado entre ellos por un interés romántico. Eso es menos probable que pase ahora. Aunque algunos grupos criminales continuan actuando y no son castigados legalmente, dijo Izquiel, el gobierno venezolano ha reprimido y atacado a otros. Izquiel nos señaló al asesinato de Carlos Luis Revete alias ""El Koki"" a quien autoridades del gobierno mataron en 2022, después de que operó por años impunemente, según InSight Crime. Revete lideraba una banda de alrededor de 120 hombres, reportó El País, y estaba involucrado en secuestros, extorsiones, narcotráfico y robo de carros. Algunas acciones del gobierno también han llevado a las organizaciones internacionales y de derechos humanos a acusar al gobierno venezolano de llevar a cabo ejecuciones extrajudiciales. En enero de 2022, la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos condenó públicamente las ""ejecuciones extrajudiciales de jóvenes que viven en la pobreza"" citando ""al menos 27 asesinatos"", cometidos por agentes del orden estatales en las dos primeras semanas del año. Criminólogos dijeron que estos asesinatos han sido un factor en la disminución de las muertes violentas en el país: El gobierno mata a las personas que matan. ""Esa acción por parte del gobierno no apoyaría la tesis de que el gobierno los está enviando, se supone que primero los está matando"", dijo Briceño León. ""Hay menos homicidios porque hay menos homicidas"". En los últimos dos años, expertos basados en la inmigración en Estados Unidos y Latinoamérica han coincidido con los criminólogos venezolanos con los que hablamos este mes: La declaración de que Venezuela está trasladando criminales a Estados Unidos no tiene base. ""No hay evidencia de que el gobierno de Maduro (líder autoritario de Venezuela)  esté liberando cárceles o mandando presos hacia los Estados Unidos"", dijo Izquiel a PolitiFact. LaSusa de InSight Crime le dijo a PolitiFact que el gobierno de Venezuela ""tampoco tiene una política conocida de seleccionar a ciertos migrantes para enviarlos a cualquier país específico, incluyendo los Estados Unidos"". El Observatorio Venezolano de Prisiones, una organización sin fines de lucro independiente que rastrea la población de prisiones en Venezuela, no ha reportado que las prisiones se están vaciando. En su reporte de 2022, el grupo dijo que había más de 33,000 personas presas en Venezuela, a pesar de tener una capacidad para alrededor de 20,000 personas. Trump dijo que el crimen disminuyó un 67% en Venezuela porque sus pandillas y criminales emigraron a Estados Unidos. Pero ni los datos ni los comentarios de expertos respaldan esa declaración, así que la calificamos como Falsa.

"Biden in Tampa: Fact-checks of his claims on abortion, Trump","April 23, 2024",Matthew Crowley,"Abortion, Florida","Eight days before a six-week abortion ban takes effect in Florida, President Joe Biden spoke in Tampa to lay blame for restrictive measures nationwide on one person: former President Donald Trump. In a 12-minute address April 23 at Hillsborough Community College, Biden warned of ""extreme"" laws that restrict abortion access, and he blamed Trump, his predecessor and presumptive 2024 rival, for making those policies possible. Biden criticized Trump for bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade and paving the way for states to enact strict limits on abortion. Using that new power, Biden said, Arizona reinstated an 1864 total abortion ban and Florida instituted its six-week ban. Biden and his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, in recent days have made abortion key to their campaign message. Biden shouted his remarks at times, but some of his statements left out context. Biden’s address comes as Florida voters are set to decide whether to expand abortion rights in a high-stakes abortion measure on the November ballot. Polls show that six-week abortion bans are unpopular both nationally and in Florida. For bans later in pregnancy, around 16 weeks, polling results are inconsistent. A national KFF poll from February 2024 found that 58% opposed federal ban on abortion at 16 weeks while 42% said they would support one. But an Economist/YouGov poll the same month found the opposite: 48% favoring a 16-week ban, 36% opposed and 16% not sure. Polling also shows wide support for first-trimester abortions, but far less for second-trimester abortions. Here are fact-checks of four things Biden said. Although we can’t know what goes on in private, Biden’s claim conflicts with Trump’s most recent public comments on abortion. On April 8, Trump released a video on his abortion position and later told reporters that he wouldn’t sign a nationwide ban if it came to his desk. In his video, Trump boasted about appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that federally protected abortion access. Trump also said he thought that abortion regulation should be left to the states, and that he supports exceptions for rape, incest and the pregnant woman’s life. On the campaign trail, Trump has criticized some of the stricter abortion bans. He called Florida’s six-week law poised to take effect May 1 ""a terrible mistake."" And he agreed that Arizona’s newly resurrected 1864 total abortion ban went too far. Before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, Trump expressed more support for a federal abortion ban. In 1999, Trump described himself as ""pro-choice."" He adopted an antiabortion stance around 2011, when he told a conservative committee that he was ""pro-life."" When Trump was president in 2017, he endorsed a 20-week national abortion ban that failed to pass. In February, The New York Times reported that Trump floated a 16-week nationwide abortion ban in private discussions. In March, Trump indicated in a radio interview that he would back a 15-week ban. Trump surrogates have discussed other executive actions Trump could use once in office, such as enforcing the Comstock Act — a 19th century law that bans the mailing of ""obscene"" material — that could outlaw abortion across the country by prohibiting sending materials such as medication and surgical equipment that could be used in abortions. Project 2025, a policy platform by a coalition of Trump-aligned groups for a second potential Trump presidency, also referred to the law in its online agenda. Trump hasn’t said he would enforce the law this way, but he hasn’t disavowed it either. This is misleading. In 2023, we rated a similar statement by Biden Mostly False. Trump made a comment about punishing women in 2016 but quickly walked it back. During a March 2016 MSNBC town hall, an audience member asked Trump about his stance on women’s rights in reproductive health decisions. Trump said he was ""pro-life,"" with exceptions, but gave no further details. In a back-and-forth, host Chris Matthews asked Trump about legal penalties: Matthews: ""Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no, as a principle?"" Trump: ""The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment."" Matthews: ""For the woman?"" Trump: ""Yeah, there has to be some form."" But Trump retracted the comment that same day after pro- and anti-abortion activists roundly criticized him. He issued a statement that said he meant that physicians should be held legally responsible, not women. It said: ""If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb."" The next day, Trump told ""Fox & Friends"" hosts, ""If, in fact, abortion was outlawed, the person performing the abortion, the doctor or whoever it may be that is really doing the act is responsible for the act, not the woman, is responsible."" This leaves out that Trump has criticized Arizona’s recent legal action affecting abortion access. On April 9, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled in favor of bringing back a Civil War-era law that would ban all abortions except when a pregnant woman's life is endangered. Under the law, abortion providers could face two to five years in prison. Barring other legal or legislative action, the abortion measure could take effect as early as June. The law is part of Arizona’s Howell Code, nearly 500 pages of laws that governed the Arizona territory before the state’s official 1912 establishment. Following the court’s ruling, the Republican-led Arizona House blocked efforts to move forward on a repeal of the 1864 law. The state Senate launched a similar repeal effort. The Arizona court concluded that ""absent the federal constitutional abortion right"" the 1864 law is enforceable. Trump took credit for overturning that federal right. Following the ruling, Trump said April 10, ""It’s all about state's rights, and that'll be straightened out. I'm sure that the governor and everybody else are going to bring it back into reason and that'll be taken care of, I think, very quickly."" Trump was more specific on Truth Social two days later, stating that the Arizona court ""went too far on their Abortion Ruling, enacting and approving an inappropriate Law from 1864."" He called on Arizona lawmakers to ""remedy what has happened"" and called for exceptions for rape, incest and the pregnant woman’s life. This is accurate. At six weeks, most women don’t yet know they are pregnant and haven’t had a chance to see a doctor. And the number of women in that statistic is poised to grow when Florida’s six-week abortion ban takes effect May 1. If the 1864 Arizona law takes effect, it would ban all abortions except when a pregnant woman’s life is in danger. Barring other legal or legislative action, the abortion measure could be instated as early as June, Axios reported. Excluding Florida and Arizona, about 21.5 million women and girls of reproductive age currently live in states that ban abortions completely, or after six weeks of pregnancy, U.S. Census data shows. That’s about 29% of women ages 15 to 49. When adding in states that ban abortion after 12 or 15 weeks of pregnancy, the number of affected women grows to about 25 million, or about 40%.

El caso criminal contra Donald Trump en Manhattan no es un juicio ordenado por Joe Biden,"April 23, 2024",Amy Sherman,"Elections, Legal Issues, PolitiFact en Español","El fiscal del distrito de Manhattan, Alvin Bragg, presentó cargos contra el expresidente Donald Trump por falsificar registros comerciales para pagar a la actriz porno Stormy Daniels. Pero Trump dice que el presidente Joe Biden es realmente la persona detrás del caso. Trump ha hecho la afirmación muchas veces en muchos lugares. ""Este juicio que tengo ahora, ese es un juicio de Biden"", dijo Trump el 16 de abril frente a una bodega de la ciudad de Nueva York en el segundo día de selección de jurados. ""Dos días a partir de ahora, todo el mundo será testigo del inicio del primer juicio de Biden"", dijo en un mitin el 13 de abril en Pensilvania. ""A medida que ustedes presencian este juicio de Biden, pido a todos los estadounidenses que recuerden que esto no se trata solo de mí, esto se trata de nuestro país y esto se trata de ustedes"", dijo Trump en un video el 15 de abril. Pero esto es falso. No hay evidencia de que Biden haya orquestado los cargos contra Trump. Bragg dijo en abril de 2023 que Trump fue acusado de 34 cargos de falsificación de registros comerciales para encubrir un pago de $130,000 a Daniels realizado a través del entonces abogado de Trump, Michael Cohen. (El nombre real de Daniels es Stephanie Clifford.) ""Alvin Bragg es un fiscal estatal independiente elegido que no tiene nada que ver con Biden, el Departamento de Justicia o el gobierno federal"", dijo Karen Friedman Agnifilo, abogada de defensa penal que trabajó en la fiscalía del distrito de Manhattan antes de que Bragg asumiera el cargo. ""De hecho, si Trump fuera condenado, incluso si quisiera, Biden no podría indultarlo. Es completamente y totalmente separado en todos los sentidos"". PolitiFact contactó a un portavoz de la campaña de Trump para esta nota pero no recibimos respuesta. La investigación de Manhattan sobre Trump comenzó antes de que Biden fuera presidente La investigación sobre los registros comerciales de Trump se basa en la ley estatal de Nueva York. El Departamento de Justicia sólo procesa delitos federales en tribunales federales y no puede controlar enjuiciamientos estatales, dijo Frank O. Bowman III, profesor de Derecho de la Universidad de Missouri y exfiscal local en Denver y fiscal federal en Florida. ""Los fiscales de distrito locales procesan violaciones penales estatales en tribunales penales estatales"", dijo Bowman. ""No están bajo el control del Departamento de Justicia de EE. UU. Además, en mi experiencia, son ferozmente independientes y se resistirían a cualquier esfuerzo del Departamento de Justicia de EE. UU. para interferir en su toma de decisiones"". La investigación de Manhattan sobre Trump comenzó en 2018, antes de que Biden fuera presidente. Enfrentó muchos giros, vueltas y retrasos en medio de la pandemia de coronavirus, las elecciones presidenciales de 2020 y la renuncia de los fiscales principales. Después de que Cohen se declarara culpable de cargos federales en 2018, el entonces fiscal del distrito de Manhattan, Cyrus Vance Jr., abrió una investigación sobre los pagos, informó Politico. Los fiscales federales no pudieron acusar a Trump entonces debido a la política del Departamento de Justicia de no presentar cargos penales contra un presidente en ejercicio, reportó Politico. Después de que los fiscales federales concluyeron su investigación, Vance, en agosto de 2019, utilizó un requerimiento judicial para obtener los registros fiscales personales y corporativos de Trump. Los abogados de Trump lucharon contra el requerimiento, y la Corte Suprema de EE. UU. en julio de 2020 falló a favor de Vance. Para cuando Vance obtuvo los registros, era febrero de 2021, ya al principio de la presidencia de Biden. Bragg fue elegido para reemplazar a Vance y asumió el cargo en 2022. Cualquier cooperación entre fiscales federales y locales generalmente es voluntaria, dijo Melissa Redmon, exfiscal local en Georgia y profesora de Derecho de la Universidad de Georgia. Cuando Bragg buscó registros federales sobre el teléfono de Cohen, los fiscales federales declinaron, diciendo que ""sería excesivamente engorroso"". Los abogados de Trump utilizaron un requerimiento judicial para obtener los registros de la Fiscalía del Distrito Sur de Nueva York. ""Habríamos visto mucha más información compartida desde antes si las oficinas estuvieran actuando de manera concertada"", dijo Redmon. Aunque Trump fue implicado en el caso de Cohen, los fiscales federales en Nueva York nunca lo acusaron. Bragg contrató a un exfiscal del Departamento de Justicia, pero eso no prueba la participación de Biden Trump, en otras ocasiones, ha destacado un vínculo con Biden y uno de los abogados que Bragg contrató para trabajar en el caso. Uno de los fiscales de Bragg, Matthew Colangelo, trabajó para el Departamento de Justicia de EE. UU. y la oficina del fiscal general de Nueva York antes de que Bragg dijera que se uniría a la Fiscalía en diciembre de 2022. En marzo, Trump dijo que Colangelo era un fiscal ""radical de izquierda"" que fue ""colocado en la fiscalía para llevar el juicio contra Trump"". En sus dos años en el Departamento de Justicia, Colangelo ayudó a supervisar las divisiones de competencia, civil, derechos civiles, medio ambiente y recursos naturales, y de impuestos. Colangelo se desempeñó como fiscal general asociado interino, el tercer cargo más alto del departamento, durante los primeros meses de la administración Biden, hasta que Vanita Gupta fue confirmada. Colangelo luego se desempeñó como fiscal general asociado principal. Colangelo también sirvió en la administración Obama. Cuando Colangelo trabajó para el fiscal general de Nueva York, investigó a la Fundación Trump y lideró demandas contra la administración Trump. The New York Times informó que Bragg y Colangelo coincidieron en la oficina del fiscal general. Pero la presencia de Colangelo en el equipo de Bragg no prueba que Biden, o funcionarios de su Casa Blanca o campaña, estuvieran involucrados en el caso. Varios de los abogados consultados por PolitiFact dijeron que no es sorprendente que Bragg contratara a Colangelo, un fiscal experimentado con experiencia en la investigación de Trump. Los fiscales comúnmente se mueven entre empleos en oficinas federales, estatales y locales de alto perfil. ""La posición anterior más relevante ocupada por Colangelo no son sus trabajos en el DOJ, sino el cargo de fiscal general de Nueva York en el que participó en la investigación de la Fundación Trump"", dijo Bowman. ""Apostaría a que Bragg lo contrató en parte debido a su familiaridad con las complejidades de los negocios y transacciones financieras de Trump. Pero, nuevamente, eso no prueba absolutamente nada sobre la influencia de Biden en el caso de Manhattan"". Bill Otis, exjefe de la División de Apelaciones de la Fiscalía del Distrito Este de Virginia y exfiscal especial del expresidente George H.W. Bush, planteó preguntas sobre la contratación de Colangelo por parte de Bragg. ""Hay aproximadamente un millón de abogados inteligentes en la Costa Este"", dijo. ""¿Por qué Alvin Bragg necesita usar uno con vínculos de alto nivel con el DOJ de Biden?"". Sin embargo, Trump está exagerando, dijo Otis. La contratación de Colangelo por parte de Bragg ""no prueba la participación personal de Biden en la investigación y/o acusación de Trump"" pero no huele bien. La investigación del fiscal del distrito de Manhattan sobre Trump comenzó en 2018, antes de que Biden fuera presidente. Así que calificamos la declaración de Trump, que Biden ordenó el juicio, como Falsa. Una versión de este artículo fue escrita originalmente en inglés.

"Fact-checking Aaron Rodgers, who repeated Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s false claims about HIV/AIDS","April 22, 2024",Madison Czopek,"Health Care, LGBTQ, Coronavirus","Aaron Rodgers, already famous after nearly two decades as an NFL quarterback, is drawing a new kind of notoriety for peddling conspiracy theories. Recently, a video clip went viral of Rodgers, known for his anti-vaccine views, criticizing Dr. Anthony Fauci’s handling of the AIDS epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic during his decadeslong tenure as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In the 1980s, it was ""the game plan"" to ""create an environment where only one thing works,"" Rodgers said in the video, adding that Fauci pushed certain infectious disease treatments for personal gain. The video clip is from a Feb. 23 episode of the ""Look Into It"" podcast hosted by martial arts instructor and self-described conspiracy theorist Eddie Bravo. The interview resurfaced April 16 when a clip from it was shared on X and viewed more than 13 million times. In the three-hour-long podcast interview, which requires paid access, Rodgers compared the AIDS epidemic with the COVID-19 pandemic, centering Fauci as the mastermind orchestrating the U.S. government’s response to both public health crises. Rodgers said Fauci promoted an antiretroviral drug in the 1980s called zidovudine, also known as azidothymidine or AZT, to treat HIV. Rodgers falsely claimed that taking AZT was ""killing people"" at that time. Rodgers, who was once considered a potential running mate for independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., cited Kennedy’s 2021 book ""The Real Anthony Fauci"" as the source for this statement. (Kennedy selected Nicole Shanahan, a lawyer and tech entrepreneur, as his running mate in March.) Kennedy is an anti-vaccine activist whose presidential campaign of conspiracy theories was PolitiFact’s 2023 Lie of the Year. He repeats false talking points from other people who say that HIV does not cause AIDS, and this AIDS denialism was apparent in his Fauci book. We contacted Rodgers and Kennedy for comment and received no response. Here’s how Kennedy’s anti-Fauci narrative about the AIDS crisis misinformed Rodgers, who then reshared those falsehoods with millions of people who might never read Kennedy’s book.  Some of thousands who came to view the AIDS quilt on the National Mall look over the panels Oct. 12, 1992 in Washington D.C. At the time, the quilt, which is a tribute to people who died of AIDS, consisted of over 20,000 individual panels. (AP) Human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is an infection that attacks the body’s immune system. Left untreated, HIV can progress to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. HIV currently has no cure; once people get HIV, they have it for life, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The false claim that AZT, rather than AIDS, killed hundreds of thousands of people emerged during the 1980s AIDS crisis, an expert told PolitiFact. We fact-checked in 2023 a similar claim that ""hundreds of thousands"" of people died from taking AZT and rated it False. After AZT proved ineffective against cancer, it was tested in the 1980s as an HIV/AIDS treatment. In lab tests, AZT slowed HIV replication without harming normal cells, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In subsequent clinical trials, AZT ""decreased deaths and opportunistic infections, albeit with serious adverse effects,"" NIAID said. AZT was the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved medication to treat HIV. At the time, in 1987, drug approvals typically took eight to 10 years, so AZT’s approval was fast-tracked. Both the drug and its clinical trials were imperfect. Some trial patients shared the medication with other people, several AZT recipients received blood transfusions that could have helped them fight HIV and others had to stop taking the drug, according to documents published later. But experts told PolitiFact the claim that AZT killed hundreds of thousands of people was baseless. Jonathan Appelbaum, a clinical sciences professor at the Florida State University College of Medicine, told PolitiFact in June that the clinical trials of AZT ""clearly showed a survival benefit"" and that it prolonged lives even when it was used alone. The medication has side effects, but ""there has never been any case reported in the literature, that I know about, of an HIV patient whose death has been linked to AZT use or abuse,"" said Marco Salemi, an experimental pathology professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine. During the full podcast interview, Rodgers attributed his ideas about the alleged AIDS crisis-inspired ""game plan"" and the falsehood about AZT to Kennedy’s 2021 book. ""Anybody who hasn’t read RFK Jr.’s ‘The Real Anthony Fauci,’ you’re really doing yourself a disservice,"" Rodgers said. We borrowed ""The Real Anthony Fauci"" from the library. In a chapter titled, ""The Pandemic Template: AIDS and AZT,"" Kennedy created a narrative of government corruption and ineptitude with the book’s namesake — Fauci, who directed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from 1984 to 2022 and became a household name during the COVID-19 pandemic — as ringleader. By Kennedy’s account, Fauci exaggerated HIV’s transmissibility, partnered with pharmaceutical companies, ""ran AZT around regulatory traps"" and refused to research alternative AIDS therapies.  Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks to supporters during a campaign event April 21, 2024, in Royal Oak, Mich. (AP) Rodgers repeated, sometimes clumsily, Kennedy’s argument that Fauci used tactics he developed during the AIDS crisis to get rapid FDA approval for the COVID-19 treatment remdesivir, which Kennedy described as Fauci’s ""pet drug"" and a ""lethal remedy."" (We’ve rated the claim that remdesivir killed COVID-19 patients False.) Kennedy employed a familiar pattern to construct his anti-Fauci narrative: He named alleged AIDS treatments that Fauci supposedly ignored, regardless of whether the scientific evidence supported their effectiveness against HIV. (Antiretroviral therapy, usually a combination of two or more drugs, is the recommended treatment for HIV.) This is similar to arguments during the COVID-19 pandemic about the use of ivermectin and other unproven treatments. He focused on the flawed AZT clinical trial and the drug’s adverse effects, failing to acknowledge that after the issues became public and the drug’s recommended dose was reduced, research continued to support AZT’s effectiveness as an HIV treatment. He cherry-picked details and anecdotes from other sources — sometimes known HIV denialists — and listed dozens of citations to lend himself authority, even when the sources didn’t back his conclusions. In Kennedy’s assessment, Fauci pulled government strings and worked with pharmaceutical companies in the 1980s to get an unsafe, ineffective drug approved as the only HIV treatment. Then, Kennedy alleged Fauci used the same tactics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dan Wilson, senior associate scientist at Janssen and host of the YouTube show ""Debunk the Funk with Dr. Wilson,"" said Kennedy’s retelling of the AZT history was ""dead wrong."" Kennedy and Rodgers were ""repeating a form of HIV/AIDS denialism, where antiretroviral drugs are said to be ineffective against progression of the virus,"" Wilson said. In reality, he said, AZT ""was the first time that doctors could do something to help people who (were) wasting away and dying painful deaths."" Rodgers focused on the idea of ""one approved treatment"" for HIV. But Dr. Jonathan Laxton, a University of Manitoba general internal medicine professor, said other drug approvals followed while Fauci was leading the institute, and there are now more than 25 antiretroviral drugs available to treat HIV. Wilson and Laxton said this type of misinformation about antiretroviral therapy and HIV causes lasting harm. ""Anyone who treats patients infected with HIV has had patients who have declined effective therapy because they think it is toxic or that they don’t have a viral infection,"" Laxton said, adding that false claims also increase stigma around HIV.

The Supreme Court will decide Donald Trump’s immunity case. Here are the arguments.,"April 22, 2024",Louis Jacobson,Legal Issues,"On April 25, former President Donald Trump will get his day in court — the Supreme Court. That’s when his lawyers will make the case that he should be covered by legal immunity from prosecution. Trump is arguing that Special Counsel Jack Smith cannot prosecute him because presidents are protected from prosecution. Smith is pursuing two cases against Trump. In one, Trump is accused of retaining and mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House. In the other, Trump is charged with conspiracy and obstruction related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which Trump lost. Smith counters that immunizing Trump from prosecution would essentially put him above the law and enable him to act with impunity. In their March 19 written brief to the justices, Trump’s lawyers said, ""The president cannot function, and the presidency itself cannot retain its vital independence, if the president faces criminal prosecution for official acts once he leaves office."" But Smith, arguing at the high court on the government’s behalf, said in his own brief to the justices that Trump seeks ""a novel and sweeping immunity from the federal criminal laws that govern all citizens’ conduct."" Legal scholars told PolitiFact they expect the government to prevail on the merits, as has been the case at lower courts. ""I think the prosecution is likely to win, at least to a large extent,"" said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor. ""But the court might carve out some area of immunity."" Ahead of the two sides’ meeting before the justices, here’s an argument-by-argument rundown of each side’s case. A president would be weakened by being a perpetual target of prosecutors. If the Supreme Court sides with the government and denies presidential immunity, Trump’s lawyers write that it ""would incapacitate every future president with de facto blackmail and extortion while in office, and condemn him to years of post-office trauma at the hands of political opponents. The threat of future prosecution and imprisonment would become a political cudgel to influence the most sensitive and controversial presidential decisions, taking away the strength, authority, and decisiveness of the presidency."" There is no historical precedent for prosecuting a president. Trump’s lawyers cite ""a 234-year unbroken tradition of not prosecuting former presidents for their official acts, despite ample motive and opportunity to do so."" As evidence, they cite such unprosecuted examples as old as President John Quincy Adams allegedly striking a ""corrupt bargain"" by appointing Henry Clay as secretary of state after Clay helped deliver the 1824 election to him in the House, and ones as recent as President Bill Clinton’s pardon of financier and campaign donor Marc Rich, President George W. Bush’s use of dubious intelligence to help justify launching the Iraq War and President Barack Obama’s drone strikes that killed civilians overseas. The absence of prosecutions in cases such as these, they argue, ""demonstrates that the newly discovered alleged power (to prosecute) does not exist."" The president is protected by separation of powers. Separation of powers is the legal notion that limits the extent to which one branch of government can insert itself into the affairs of another branch. Trump’s lawyers cite the ruling in the landmark 1803 case Marbury v. Madison, which said partly that a president’s official acts ""can never be examinable by the courts."" They also cite the 1982 decision in Nixon v. Fitzgerald. The justices ruled that the president, then Richard Nixon, cannot be held liable in civil cases ""for acts within the ‘outer perimeter’ of his official responsibility."" The ruling cited the ""president's unique office, rooted in the constitutional tradition of separation of powers."" Although  Nixon v. Fitzgerald addressed a civil case, instead of criminal prosecutions like the ones Trump is facing, his lawyers argue that it supports the notion that the judicial branch ""cannot sit in judgment directly over the president’s official acts."" Impeachment and removal is required before criminal prosecution. Trump’s lawyers argue that prosecution is impossible because the Constitution provides another mechanism: impeachment. As president, Trump survived two impeachment trials, because less than the required two-thirds of senators voted to convict. The Constitution’s passages on impeachment, Trump’s lawyers argue, reflect ""the founders’ understanding that only a president ‘convicted’ by the Senate after impeachment could be criminally prosecuted."" In so doing, they argue, the founders ""carefully balanced the public interest"" of ensuring presidents are held accountable for wrongdoing while guarding against ""the mortal danger to our system of government"" that ""political targeting of the chief executive"" could present. Trump is being targeted individually. Trump’s lawyers argue that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in the government’s favor and prompted Trump’s appeal, wrote its ruling so narrowly as to target Trump and the particularities in his case. They contend that doing so falls short of equal justice, arguing that it creates ""the appearance of a gerrymandered ruling tailored to deprive only President Trump of immunity, while leaving all other Presidents untouched."" No person is above the law. Smith’s brief says that the framers never envisioned a president having perpetual immunity from prosecution. It is ""a bedrock principle of our constitutional order"" that ""no person is above the law — including the president,"" Smith wrote in the brief. ""Nothing in constitutional text, history, precedent, or policy considerations supports the absolute immunity that (Trump) seeks."" Relieving presidents of prosecution could give them a green light to engage in ""bribery, murder, treason, and sedition,"" Smith wrote. Criminal law is more serious than civil law. Smith argues that Nixon v. Fitzgerald’s focus on civil cases rather than criminal prosecutions undermines its usefulness in making the case for criminal immunity. ""This case involves the far weightier interest in vindicating federal criminal law in a prosecution brought by the executive branch itself,"" the brief says. ""That was not true in Fitzgerald."" The impeachment clause contemplates criminal prosecution. Smith argues that rather than offering an alternative to criminal prosecution, the impeachment process specifically envisions separate criminal prosecutions. He cites Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution, which says, ""Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law."" Trump is a former president, not a sitting president. ""The framers never endorsed criminal immunity for a former president, and all presidents from the founding to the modern era have known that after leaving office they faced potential criminal liability for official acts,"" Smith writes. The smoking gun, he argues, is President Gerald Ford’s pardon of Nixon after he resigned amid the Watergate scandal. Nixon’s ""acceptance of a pardon implied his and President Ford’s recognition that a former president was subject to prosecution,"" Smith writes. The lack of prosecutions historically doesn’t mean that prosecutions aren’t valid. ""The absence of any prosecutions of former presidents until this case does not reflect the understanding that presidents are immune from criminal liability,"" Smith writes. ""It instead underscores the unprecedented nature of (the) petitioner’s alleged conduct."""
Did a nongovernment organization in Mexico encourage migrants to vote for Biden? What we know,"April 19, 2024",Maria Briceño,"Immigration, Border Security, Homeland Security","False claims that Democrats want noncitizens to vote have been amplified by former President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Republican influencers. Now a social media post is claiming to have evidence of a scheme to encourage noncitizen migrants to vote for President Joe Biden. The Oversight Project run by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, posted on X what it said was a Spanish-language flyer distributed by the Resource Center Matamoros in Mexico. The Mexican organization provides legal and social support services to migrants trying to get to the United States. ""Flyers distributed at NGO in Mexico encouraging illegals to vote for President Biden,"" said the caption of Oversight Project’s April 15 post, which has more than 9 million views. (NGO stands for nongovernmental organization.) The flyer said in Spanish: ""Reminder to vote for president Biden when you are in the United States. We need another four years of his mandate to stay open."" The flyer shows the Resource Center Matamoros’ logo, address, website and phone number. It also shows a Biden campaign logo with the phrase in Spanish: ""Todos con Biden,"" (All with Biden.) But a Biden campaign spokesperson called the flyer ""disinformation"" and the center’s leader told news outlets her group didn’t make it. Here’s what we know. The Oversight Project said on X that the flyer was posted throughout the Resource Center Matamoros’ facilities, including the wall of a portable bathroom and that ""they also appear to be handed out when illegal aliens"" seek the center’s assistance. The Oversight Project shared a video that it said comes from an X account, @realmuckraker that posts about the border and immigration. The video shows tents and portable bathrooms; the person filming the video enters multiple bathrooms and finds the flyer hanging on a wall. These flyers were discovered by @realmuckraker throughout the Resource Center Matamoras (RCM) location including on the walls of port-a-pottiesThey also appear to be handed out when illegal aliens use the RCM for assistance in coming to the USA pic.twitter.com/hvlkwOI5Xs The flyer raised concerns with conservatives. On X, Florida state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, R-Spring Hill,  shared the Oversight Project’s post, and said he would file a bill in the next legislative session that would make it a felony to distribute literature such as the flyer and would fine any Florida organization that distributed such literature. U.S. Reps. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., also showed a poster with the flyer at an April 16 House hearing questioning Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The Oversight Project has linked Mayorkas to the center. Oversight Project Executive Director Mike Howell told PolitiFact his organization made no claims about who made or distributed the flyer, but was shocked ""that such a flyer was at a non-profit that is staging illegal aliens to enter the United States."" ""The Oversight Project is currently investigating a myriad of threads to the integrity of our election system and remains concerned about the foreign influence that illegals can have in our voting system,"" Howell said. The Oversight Project on X also posted a nine-second audio clip of a conversation between a man and a woman, which the center said is Resource Center Matamoros founder Gaby Zavala. ""In all honesty, we’re just trying to help as many people as possible before, you know, before Trump gets re-elected,"" the man said. ""Believe me, we are in the same boat,"" the woman said. It’s unclear from the clip whether the woman’s voice is Zavala’s or the conversation is in full context. The flyer mentions that the center is the home of HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. The center has rented space to the society, for which Mayorkas served on the board before becoming DHS secretary. But the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society told The Associated Press that it neither made the flyers nor supported the flyer’s message. The society also said it hasn’t rented space or had ties with the Mexican center since 2022. Biden’s campaign told PolitiFact it had nothing to do with that flyer. ""This is disinformation, and should be labeled that way on platforms Americans trust to provide truthful information — from the social platform where it originated to the media organizations reporting on it,"" Ammar Moussa, a Biden campaign spokesperson, told PolitiFact via email. Zavala told The Associated Press she doesn’t know who made the flyer and that her group ""does not encourage immigrants to register to vote or cast ballots in the U.S."" We called and emailed Zavala and her organization, but received no response. Fox News National Correspondent Bill Melugin posted on X that the flyer ""seems fake or doctored, even at first glance,"" and noted several dubious elements, including that the Spanish word for welcome is misspelled and that some of the text is a translation of the organization’s website. PolitiFact also examined the flyer closely. Here are some notable details: Flyer says ""Bienvedinos,"" a misspelling of ""bienvenidos"" — the Spanish word for welcome. The first two sentences in the flyer appear to be an exact Spanish translation of the organizations Who We Are page. We pasted the English sentences on Google Translate and it gave us the exact Spanish phrasing seen in the flyer. (Screenshot of flyer from Oversight Project’s X post.) The center’s Our Mission, Who We Are and Our Services website pages do not say it supports Biden, nor do they tell asylum seekers to support him. The Who We Are page says that the center has worked ""closely with representatives from the US and Mexican governments … for more humane treatment of asylum seekers."" PolitiFact has debunked similar misinformation about noncitizens voting. Some false claims say that voter registration by noncitizens is rampant and that the Biden administration wants to end voter ID laws so that noncitizens can register and vote. Only U.S. citizens are eligible to vote in federal elections for Congress and president. Some cities, including in California, Maryland and Vermont, allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, such as for mayor or city council. Election officials told PolitiFact that fears of noncitizen voting ignore states’ safeguards to prevent it from happening. ""It’s important for people to know that voter registration is secure, and eligibility is verified through several mechanisms,"" said Amanda López Askin, the local elections official in Doña Ana County, New Mexico. ""Disinformation is dangerous to migrants, election officials, and is overall unhealthy for our democracy."""
Was Joe Biden’s uncle eaten by cannibals after World War II crash? Experts say it’s highly unlikely,"April 18, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"History, Military, Veterans","Was one of President Joe Biden’s relatives eaten by cannibals during World War II? As far-fetched as that scenario might sound, Biden said it was possible while visiting Pennsylvania on April 17. While visiting Scranton, his family’s hometown, for a speech, Biden sought out a local veterans’ memorial where his uncle, Ambrose J. Finnegan, is honored. Finnegan, who was called ""Uncle Bosie,"" died during World War II, when the future president was a toddler. Reporters asked Biden about the memorial visit before he boarded Air Force One at Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport. Biden said his uncle’s plane was shot down over New Guinea — and he floated cannibalism as the reason his remains were never recovered. ""He got shot down in an area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time,"" Biden said. ""They never recovered his body. But the government went back … and they checked and found some parts of the plane and the like."" Biden said he was contrasting his uncle’s military service with a reported 2020 statement by his opponent, former President Donald Trump, that service members were a bunch of ""suckers"" and ""losers."" (Trump has denied saying this, but one of his White House chiefs of staff, John Kelly, later corroborated that Trump said it.) Biden mentioned cannibalism again later the same day, while speaking at the United Steelworkers’ Pittsburgh headquarters. ""He flew those single-engine planes as reconnaissance over war zones,"" Biden said. ""And he got shot down in New Guinea, and they never found the body because there used to be — there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea."" Could Finnegan have been eaten by cannibals? Although cannibalism existed in New Guinea, the military record and experts in New Guinea’s history and culture say it is unlikely that Finnegan was cannibalized, because the plane crashed into the ocean, and even if indigenous people had found Finnegan, a U.S. service member wouldn’t have fit into the two categories of people at risk of being cannibalized: enemies and family members. New Guinea, the world’s second-largest island, consists of two parts today: the independent nation of Papua New Guinea in the east, and the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua in the west. According to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, a plane carrying a three-man crew and Finnegan, a passenger, was ""forced to ditch"" in the ocean off the north coast of New Guinea ""for unknown reasons"" May 14, 1944. The engine in the plane, which had been on a courier mission, failed at low altitude; the account does not specify that it was ""shot down,"" as Biden said. ""The aircraft's nose hit the water hard,"" the Pentagon agency documentation says. ""Three men failed to emerge from the sinking wreck and were lost in the crash. One crew member survived and was rescued by a passing barge. An aerial search the next day found no trace of the missing aircraft or the lost crew members."" Finnegan was not linked to any remains recovered from the area after the war, and he is officially unaccounted for, the agency said. Finnegan is memorialized on the Walls of the Missing at the Manila American Cemetery in the Philippines. The White House did not answer our inquiry for this article. White House spokesman Andrew Bates told CNN that ""President Biden is proud of his uncle’s service in uniform"" and that he ""highlighted his uncle’s story as he made the case for honoring our sacred commitment … to equip those we send to war and take care of them and their families when they come home.’"" We asked experts on New Guinea whether cannibalism was prevalent then. The experts said it existed, but added that it was uncommon when the plane crashed in the 1940s and that it almost certainly didn’t factor into the aftermath of the crash that killed Finnegan. ""There were regions of New Guinea where cannibalism was practiced in the past,"" said Alex Golub, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Hawaii-Mānoa. ""The majority, perhaps the vast majority, of the population of the country never practiced it."" Experts cautioned that outsiders sometimes exaggerated stories of cannibalism to justify colonial rule. By the World War II era, authorities had largely suppressed cannibalism, sometimes by force. ""Explorers from Captain Cook to more recent twentieth-century encounters in the New Guinea Highlands have searched obsessively for evidence of cannibalism,"" said Rainer F. Buschmann, a historian at California State University Channel Islands. ""Cannibalism then becomes an excuse to annex, exploit, and colonize the ‘other.’"" A U.S. service member wouldn’t have fit the profile of someone who might be cannibalized, experts said. ""The categories of people, and their parts, that were eaten had to do with formalized social relationships, not strangers, or monsters from the air,"" said Frederick H. Damon, an emeritus anthropology professor at the University of Virginia. With cannibalism of family members, the practices were ""part of an attempt to reincorporate some of the person back into his or her lineage,"" said Courtney Handman, an associate anthropology professor at the University of Texas at Austin. ""It is much less likely that it would have been done for an unknown person who crashed his plane nearby."" Experts said many people in New Guinea knew enough about the war not to consider someone like Finnegan an enemy, especially if they lived near typical military flight paths, said Bruce M. Knauft, an Emory University anthropology professor. Some New Guineans volunteered to fight for the allies. Even eight decades later, remains of World War II pilots are still being recovered on the island of New Guinea and off its coast. Given the need to cooperate on such searches, Biden is ill-advised to resurface the cannibalism trope, the University of Hawaii’s Golub said. The people of New Guinea ""volunteered to fight in World War II and otherwise aided the allied cause,"" Golub said. ""They fought bravely and honorably, and very effectively, and their work to fight fascism is what deserves to be remembered, not rumors about cannibalism.""

"Fact-check: Trump misleads on jury selection, request to Judge Merchan for time off","April 17, 2024",Jeff Cercone,"National, Legal Issues, New York","Former President Donald Trump spread false and misleading statements about his Manhattan criminal trial as lawyers haggled over choosing jurors and the judge faced a new request to skip a day on Trump’s behalf. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in an alleged scheme to cover up a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Unusual scenes played out in and out of the courtroom during the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Defense lawyers and prosecutors examined jurors’ social media posts and probed them about their feelings on Trump. Meanwhile, reporters described the Republican presidential nominee at times dozing off in court, which Trump’s campaign denied. After Trump appeared to mutter in the direction of a juror, Judge Juan Merchan told defense attorneys to speak to him: ""I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom,"" Merchan said. Trump spoke to gathered reporters before and after each day of jury selection, making familiar and baseless accusations about what he called a ""conflicted"" judge and calling the trial a ""political persecution."" On his social media platform, Truth Social, he repeated his misleading characterization of the matter as a ""Biden case."" Here’s a look at some of Trump’s misleading statements about the trial. Donald Trump discusses his request to have his trial delayed a day to attend his son's graduation in Florida. (AP, YouTube) On the first day of jury selection, Trump asked Merchan not to hold trial on May 17 so he could attend his son Barron’s high school graduation. The school ceremony at Oxbridge Academy in Palm Beach, Florida, is scheduled for 10 a.m. that day and the trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. Trump made some conflicting comments to reporters and on Truth Social about the judge’s response. Trump sometimes said the judge ""likely"" wouldn’t allow him to attend but at other times described it as a decision already announced: Merchan ""is preventing me from proudly attending my son’s Graduation,"" he wrote April 15. Merchan has ruled on neither Trump’s request, nor a separate request from a Trump lawyer whose own son is graduating June 3, The Associated Press reported. Merchan seemed open to the idea of adjourning for one or both days. ""It really depends on how we’re doing on time and where we are in the trial,"" Merchan said, according to The Associated Press. Criminal law experts cited legitimate reasons for Merchan to wait on that decision. Merchan will likely consider how a temporary adjournment would affect the trial’s participants, including the lawyers, witnesses and jurors. Nancy S. Marder, a jury scholar and professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, said the judge has scheduling discretion. ""The judge might consider where they are in the trial, what other breaks or days away from the trial have already been taken,"" Marder said. Sharon R. Fairley, a former federal prosecutor and current professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said it can be awkward to take whole days off during trial, potentially breaking up the ""flow of the evidence."" ""For example,"" she said, ""May 17 could fall right in the middle of the cross-examination of an important witness."" Evan Gotlob, a white-collar criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor, said the trial may even be over before May 17. ""Why make a decision you do not have to make?"" Protesters for and against Donald Trump demonstrate April 15, 2024, outside Manhattan criminal court in New York. (AP) Trump continued to criticize Merchan’s gag order, which barred Trump from speaking about witnesses, court staff or their family members. The order said he is also not allowed to speak outside of court about counsel in the case, except for Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney. Trump is also free to criticize Merchan away from court, and has. ""This conflicted, Trump Hating Judge won’t let me respond to people that are on TV lying and spewing hate all day long,"" Trump said in an April 16 Truth Social post. ""I want to speak, or at least be able to respond. Election Interference! RIGGED, UNCONSTITUTIONAL TRIAL! Take off the Gag Order!!!"" Trump’s lawyers have challenged the gag order, and courts will have the final say. Legal experts said Trump should not be allowed to make comments that incite violence. Jon Sale, a Miami white-collar criminal defense attorney, said one potentially unfair aspect of the order is that although Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer, has frequently talked about the case on television, Trump cannot rebut what Cohen says unless he does so in court. Cohen was convicted of multiple offenses. However, experts told PolitiFact the law supports gag orders. ""This case law goes back decades,"" said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law. ""Merchan followed it."" In this courtroom sketch, former President Donald Trump smiles to the jury pool April 15, 2024, as he is introduced at the beginning of his trial in Manhattan state court. (AP) Trump criticized how prospective jurors were removed — or struck — from the pool. ""I thought STRIKES were supposed to be ‘unlimited’ when we were picking our jury?"" Trump wrote in an April 17 Truth Social post. ""I was then told we only had 10."" There are two paths by which prosecution and defense may seek to remove or strike prospective jurors. The first is ""for cause,"" which means for a stated and qualified reason such as bias. The second is ""peremptory,"" which means the prosecution or defense doesn’t need to give a reason, Marder said. The cause strikes are unlimited, but the peremptory strikes for each side are capped based on the level of felony charge in this case. In Trump’s trial, they’re set at 10 for each side for the regular jurors. The prosecutor or defense can raise a challenge for cause, but that doesn't mean it will be granted, and the judge can raise a for cause challenge on his own, Marder said. The lawyers get to decide how to exercise their limited number of peremptory challenges. Jurors may not be challenged based on their race, religion, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Why limit peremptory challenges? It speeds up finding the final jury. Lawyers, Gotlob said, ""would just be kicking off people all day long, you would never have a jury."" Trump’s defense challenged some jurors based on their social media posts. Merchan struck a prospective juror who cheered on social media after Trump lost a court challenge to his Muslim travel ban: ""Get him out and lock him up,"" the person’s post had said. But Merchan declined to strike a prospective juror who wrote ""Republicans projected to pick up 70 seats in prison."" ""She was pretty open and honest that she has disagreements with his political views,"" Merchan said after agreeing with the prosecution’s argument that the woman’s posts were satirical. ""But the question is whether she can be fair and impartial.""

Fact-checking Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago press conference with Mike Johnson,"April 12, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"Abortion, Immigration, Legal Issues","Seeking to present a unified Republican front, former President Donald Trump and embattled House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., met at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, to tout several issues the GOP sees as key in the 2024 election, including voting laws and immigration. Johnson focused his remarks on forthcoming legislation to require proof of citizenship to register to vote. This push comes on top of existing efforts by the party to prevent noncitizens from voting, which is already illegal under existing law. In a televised press conference after Trump’s and Johnson’s remarks April 12, Trump made several false or misleading comments. Here are a few of them. This is False. Although Venezuelan government data is unreliable, some available data from independent organizations shows that violent deaths have recently decreased, though not by 67%. From 2022 to 2023, violent deaths dropped by 25%, according to the independent Venezuelan Observatory of Violence. However, criminologists told PolitiFact that the reason for the drop is not immigration to the United States. Violent deaths have dropped because of Venezuela’s poor economy, and the government’s extrajudicial killings, experts say. So many people have left Venezuela that criminals have fewer people to assault, too. The experts say there is no evidence that the Maduro government is emptying its prisons and sending criminals to the United States. This is False. Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric exaggerates by saying the party supports killing an unwanted infant after birth. That would be infanticide and is illegal in every state, and mainstream Democrats do not support this. Situations resulting in a fetal death in the third trimester are rare, and involve emergencies such as fetal anomalies or life-threatening medical emergencies affecting the mother. Babies that are delivered are not killed. For fetuses with very short life expectancies, doctors may induce labor and offer palliative care to make the newborn as comfortable as possible. Some families choose this option when facing diagnoses that limit their babies’ postbirth survival to just minutes or days after delivery, reproductive health experts said. At the press conference, Trump called back to a controversy from 2019. In 2019, Trump said that Virginia’s then-governor, Democrat Ralph Northam, ""stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world and wrap the baby, and make the baby comfortable, and then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby. Execute the baby."" We ruled at the time that Trump was putting words in Northam’s mouth and rated it False. Northam, a physician, never said he would sanction the execution of newborns. He said during a radio interview that in rare, late-pregnancy cases when fetuses are nonviable, doctors deliver the baby, keep it comfortable, resuscitate it if the mother wishes and then have a ""discussion"" with the mother. There is no evidence that the Biden administration has been colluding with the Manhattan DA’s office to prosecute Trump. Trump is referring to one of Bragg’s prosecutors, Matthew Colangelo, who formerly worked for the Justice Department and the New York attorney general. While working for the New York attorney general, Colangelo investigated the Trump Foundation and led lawsuits against the Trump administration. Some legal experts told PolitiFact that Bragg could have avoided controversy by not hiring Colangelo, but they agreed that his hiring does not signal that the White House or campaign officials coordinated with the district attorney’s office. ""Why would it be strange or suspicious for a prosecutor to hire another prosecutor with a New York license and experience working on complex prosecutorial matters?"" said Matthew J. Galluzzo, who worked as a Manhattan prosecutor before Bragg’s tenure and is now in private practice. ""Most federal prosecutors in this country have worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations."" An independent special counsel, Robert Hur, investigated Biden’s retention of documents from his vice presidency and declined to press charges, though he criticized some of Biden’s document-handling practices. Trump is in a different situation; he was indicted in June 2023 on about three dozen counts, including willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements. Hur’s report drew several distinctions between his Biden investigation and Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigation of Trump’s handling of classified documents. Hur wrote in his report that Biden cooperated with the investigation by turning in documents to the National Archives and Justice Department, consenting to property searches, and sitting for an interview, while Trump thwarted federal efforts to retrieve documents. Hur wrote that according to Trump’s indictment, the former president ""not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it."" ""Trump’s indictment alleges a pattern of deliberate and willful behavior and lying to federal investigators that Hur does not find in the Biden investigation,"" Joan Meyer, who has worked as a federal and local level prosecutor and is now a partner at the law firm Thompson Hine LLP, told PolitiFact at the time.

"El primer juicio penal de Donald Trump trata de la falsificación de registros, acá los detalles","April 12, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"National, Elections, Legal Issues, PolitiFact en Español","En medio de una campaña electoral ferozmente competitiva en 2024 contra el presidente Joe Biden, el expresidente Donald Trump se convertirá en el primer expresidente sometido a un juicio penal. Trump se enfrenta a cargos por delitos graves en cuatro casos. Pero el primero en ir a juicio, y quizás el único que probablemente finalice antes del 5 de noviembre, el día de las elecciones, es un caso en Manhattan relacionado con la presunta malversación de pagos a la actriz de cine para adultos Stormy Daniels en vísperas de las elecciones de 2016. Daniels ha dicho que tuvo un amorío con Trump. Trump está acusado de 34 cargos de falsificación de registros comerciales para encubrir un pago de $130,000 a Daniels realizado a través del entonces abogado de Trump, Michael Cohen. (El verdadero nombre de Daniels es Stephanie Clifford.) El fiscal del distrito de Manhattan Alvin Bragg está procesando el caso. La selección del jurado comienza el 15 de abril. Por sí sola, la falsificación de registros en segundo grado es un delito menor. Sin embargo, el cargo se transforma en un delito grave si la persona acusada es condenada por falsificar registros comerciales con la intención de cometer otro delito o de ayudar u ocultar un delito cometido. La transformación convertiría los delitos en delitos graves de Clase E, el nivel más bajo de Nueva York. Aunque un delito grave Clase E es condenable con hasta cuatro años en prisión, si Trump es condenado, puede que él no vaya a la cárcel. Ser condenado con un delito grave no es un impedimento para lanzarse como presidente. Aun estando en prisión no le impediría servir como presidente, a pesar de que puede causar problemas logísticos significativos. A Trump se le acusa de haber realizado anotaciones falsas en registros financieros para favorecer otro delito. ""¿Por qué Donald Trump hizo repetidamente estas declaraciones falsas?"" dijo Bragg al anunciar los cargos. ""Las pruebas demostrarán que lo hizo para encubrir delitos relacionados con las elecciones de 2016"". Bragg dijo que las acciones de Trump ""violaron la ley electoral de Nueva York, la cual convierte en delito conspirar para promover una candidatura por medios ilegales."" También dijo que el pago por cable excedió el límite federal de contribución a una campaña y que las declaraciones financieras falsificadas violaron la ley de Nueva York. El número de cargos se refiere a 34 documentos que el gran jurado consideró que contenían una ""declaración falsa crítica"" relacionada con los pagos. Los cargos también incluyen documentos relacionados con Karen McDougal, una ex modelo de Playboy que dijo haber tenido un amorío con Trump, algo que Trump ha negado constantemente. Puede que el caso de Manhattan sea el primero en ir a juicio, pero los expertos jurídicos afirman que puede ser el más difícil de probar. Ellos citan tres grandes retos a los que se enfrenta la acusación. Uno de ellos es convencer a un jurado de que los cargos de falsificación comercial constituyen a un delito separado, permitiendo acusar a Trump de un delito grave. Un segundo desafío tiene que ver con algunos testigos clave del gobierno, entre ellos Cohen, quien fue condenado a tres años de prisión por evasión fiscal, hacer declaraciones falsas a un banco asegurado por el gobierno federal e incumplir las normas de financiación de campañas. Este historial significa que Cohen ""tiene serios problemas de credibilidad"", dijo Matthew J. Galluzzo, que trabajó como fiscal de Manhattan antes del mandato de Bragg y ahora se dedica a la práctica privada. Un tercer reto para los fiscales es que se necesita un veredicto unánime para condenar a Trump. Si un miembro del jurado cree que Trump está siendo tratado injustamente por el sistema de justicia civil y penal y vota en contra de la condena, entonces la fiscalía pierde el caso. El jurado estará compuesto por ciudadanos residentes en Manhattan. A pesar de que Trump vivió en el distrito durante gran parte de su vida adulta, Manhattan probablemente no sea un jurado favorable para Trump: Biden obtuvo allí el 86% de los votos en 2020. Durante la selección del jurado, los abogados de ambas partes podrán hacer preguntas a los posibles jurados para ver si tienen nociones fijas sobre el caso que les impida pronunciarse imparcialmente. El cuestionario para el jurado publicado por el tribunal incluye preguntas como los hábitos de consumo de noticias y redes sociales del posible miembro del jurado; si han apoyado o pertenecido a grupos antigubernamentales o se han identificado como QAnon; si han asistido a un evento de Trump o se han suscrito a un boletín pro-Trump; si han leído sus libros; y si ""tienen algún sentimiento de opinión sobre cómo se está tratando al señor Trump en este caso."" El juicio será todos los días de la semana excepto los miércoles, cuando Juan M. Merchan, juez interino de la Corte Suprema de Nueva York, realiza el tribunal de salud mental. La ley neoyorquina suele exigir que el acusado esté presente durante el juicio, que, en este caso, podría durar entre seis a ocho semanas. Ese calendario indica que Trump puede realizar actos de campaña por la noche, los miércoles o los fines de semana. Trump también puede seguir publicando en su plataforma Truth Social. Trump omite que la orden aún le permite criticar a personas clave con poder en la acusación. La orden de silencio de Merchan del 1 de abril impide a Trump hablar sobre los testigos o abogados en el caso (excepto de Bragg) y de hacer declaraciones sobre miembros del personal del tribunal o sus familias si interfiere con el caso.Trump puede seguir criticando a Bragg y Merchan. Las órdenes de silencio ""con excepciones muy limitadas se han considerado durante mucho tiempo que no violan la Primera Enmienda"", dijo Duncan Levin, que trabajó en la oficina del fiscal de distrito antes de Bragg y ahora es abogado defensor. Trump ""es libre de hablar del sistema de justicia penal, pero no de hacer ataques ad hominem contra personas concretas relacionadas con el caso"", dijo Levin. Los abogados de Trump han impugnado la orden de silencio y los tribunales tendrán la última palabra. Trump señala a uno de los fiscales de Bragg, Matthew Colangelo, quien anteriormente trabajó para el Departamento de Justicia y el fiscal general de Nueva York. Mientras trabajaba para el fiscal general de Nueva York, Colangelo investigó la Fundación Trump y dirigió demandas contra la administración Trump. Pero su presencia en el equipo no prueba que funcionarios de la Casa Blanca o de la campaña de Biden coordinarán el caso con Bragg. Días antes del juicio, Trump compartió en Truth Social una carta de Daniels del 30 de enero de 2018 en la que decía: ""Niego este amorío porque nunca ocurrió."" La carta se publicó  y fue ampliamente difundida en 2018. Pero poco después, Daniels se retractó, diciendo que de hecho un amorío había ocurrido. Ella dijo que sus negaciones se debían a un acuerdo de no divulgación y que firmó la carta porque las partes involucradas ""hicieron que sonara como si no tuviera otra opción."" Una versión de este artículo fue escrito originalmente en inglés y traducido por Maria Briceño y Marta Campabadal."
Republicans push for noncitizen voting ban in Congress. But a federal ban already exists.,"April 12, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"National, Congress, Elections, Legal Issues","Former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson will host an event at Mar-a-Lago on April 12 in an appearance that is expected to underscore something that PolitiFact has fact-checked repeatedly as false: allegations of rampant election fraud — most recently claims of noncitizen voting. Their joint appearance comes as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has called for Johnson’s ouster for working too closely with Democrats, and as Trump continues to make securing the border a key argument for his return to the White House. As he campaigns in 2024, Trump has repeatedly made false and ridiculous statements about the 2020 election. Trump’s election result denial has poisoned many Americans’ views on voting, misleading the public about how elections are run. So far this year, Trump, entrepreneur Elon Musk and social media influencers have spread statements that create a false impression that noncitizens’ voting or their voter registration is rampant. It isn’t. The rhetoric is fed, partly, by the reality that a minority of cities allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, such as for mayor or city council. This includes some cities in California, Maryland and Vermont, Ron Hayduk, a political science professor at San Francisco State University, previously told PolitiFact. But by law, only American citizens are allowed to vote in elections for Congress and president. Trump has made false claims about noncitizens voting stretching back to 2014, and his 2016 presidential race. He made similar statements after his 2020 loss. Trump said in January that Democrats are allowing immigrants illegally in the country ""to come in — people that don’t speak our language — they are signing them up to vote."" Trump didn’t directly identify who ""they"" are, but in his preceding comments, he talked about people who ""cheat on an election"" — language he often uses to talk about Democrats. Our search for evidence turned up sporadic cases of noncitizens registering to vote or casting ballots. But we found no effort by Democrats to register people in the country illegally. Most noncitizens don’t want to risk jail time (or deportation if they are here illegally) by casting a ballot. Election officials take several steps to ensure that only eligible voters cast ballots. We rated Trump’s statement Pants on Fire. Musk has posted about noncitizens and voting dozens of times. His posts claim that Biden is bringing in new migrants to boost votes for Democrats. Musk said in a February post on X that Biden’s strategy is to ""get as many illegals in the country as possible"" and ""legalize them to create a permanent majority."" The path to U.S. citizenship, which is required for voting in federal elections, can take a decade, so the current influx of immigrants would not lead to a significant number of new voters for many years, if ever. Even when immigrants become voting citizens, it doesn’t mean the United States will become a one-party nation. We rated Musk’s statement False. If a noncitizen is allowed to vote in a city race, that does not give that person the right to vote for president. For example, Takoma Park, Maryland, has allowed noncitizen voting for mayor and city council since 1993. About 200 noncitizens are registered to vote in elections compared with 11,200 registered citizen voters in Takoma Park. Voting for local elections is held on a separate ballot and location from state and federal elections. Jessie Carpenter, Takoma Park clerk, said if a noncitizen showed up at a polling precinct site to vote in a state or federal election, that person would not be on the roll of eligible voters. ""There is no basis for thinking these folks would be voting in state elections,"" Carpenter said. Trump has made other statements that distort the outcome of elections. Before his recent rally in Wisconsin, Trump said he won Wisconsin in 2020. He won the state in 2016, but lost in 2020. A probe led by former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman — who has aligned with Trump and promoted his false claims — turned up no evidence the election was incorrectly called. We rated Trump’s statement Pants on Fire. Many of Trump’s falsehoods pertain to voting by mail and its expansion during the pandemic. Trump said in January that Democrats ""used COVID to cheat"" in the 2020 election. Many states made voting easier during the pandemic by mailing a ballot or an application to receive a ballot to registered voters. Some states that previously required voters to have an excuse to vote by mail loosened that rule. Trump is free to disagree with these changes, but he is wrong to characterize them as cheating. These changes were made openly, through executive orders, administrative actions or law. And when a state expanded access to voting by mail, that was available to Republican voters, too. In a March speech in Greensboro, North Carolina, Trump falsely said, ""Eighty-two percent of the country understands that it was a rigged election."" Polls showed a majority of Americans believed the 2020 results were legitimate, although significant numbers of Republicans did not. Johnson aligned himself with Trump and congressional Republicans who sought to overturn legitimate results ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. ​​In December 2020, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, filed a lawsuit asking the U.S. Supreme Court to block four battleground states from voting in the Electoral College. Those four states voted for Biden. Johnson sent an email to Republican colleagues asking them to join an amicus — or ""friend of the court"" — brief in support of Paxton’s lawsuit, CNN reported. The majority of the conference, 126 Republicans, signed the brief. Johnson tweeted Dec. 10, 2020, that he was ""proud to lead"" the effort. In interviews after the election, Johnson spread falsehoods about voting machines and a ""rigged"" election. On Jan. 6, Johnson objected to certification of the election. Republicans in Congress, with a boost from Trump, are pushing for lawmakers to pass a ban on noncitizen voting. ""Congress has a role with regard to federal elections,"" Johnson said April 12, before his meeting with Trump. ""We want to make absolutely certain that anybody who votes is actually an American citizen. In some states, it's too easy. … So, we need to make sure that federal law is clear on that matter."" The proposed legislation is drawing attention because Republicans have made fear of noncitizen voting a frequent talking point as a high number of migrants cross the U.S.-Mexico border. There are a few Republican-backed legislative efforts to curb noncitizen voting. The broadest bill, the American Confidence in Elections Act, is sponsored by Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis. It currently has 131 co-sponsors, all Republicans. One provision in this bill states it will ensure ""only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections. It draws from previous legislation including the ""NO VOTE for Non-Citizens Act of 2023"" filed by Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va. The bill acknowledges that this requirement is duplicative of existing law and constitutional requirements: Noncitizens are already not allowed to vote in federal elections. Steil’s bill also has the following elements targeting noncitizen voting: A provision to require states to separate out noncitizens who are eligible to vote in local elections from citizen voters on registration lists. A provision that requires ballots given to noncitizen voters in local elections to include only the offices for which they are eligible to vote, rather than federal offices for which they may not vote. A provision to cut by 30% the federal election administration funding sent to any state that allows noncitizens to vote in local elections. A provision preventing federal funds for election administration being spent on efforts to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. These measures would fall short of banning local noncitizen voting entirely, because federalism prevents Congress from infringing on local powers over their own jurisdictions. But because of Congress’ unusual ability to influence governance in the District of Columbia, the bill would block the district directly from allowing noncitizens to vote. The district’s provisions have attracted intense opposition from voting rights groups. This bill has passed the House Administration Committee, which Steil chairs, over Democratic opposition. But it has not received a floor vote yet. Amid Republican concerns that the full bill will have trouble getting through the chamber, the committee has also approved six pieces of Steil’s bill as stand-alone legislation. Three of these smaller bills touch on noncitizen voting. One measure would ban the District of Columbia from allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections. Another spinoff bill would let states include on vote-by-mail registration applications a requirement that the applicant provide proof of U.S. citizenship. And a third bill would require the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration to respond to requests from election officials who seek to verify the citizenship of voters in their state. It’s unclear when, or if, any of these measures will come to a vote in the House. If they do pass the House, the ones that receive widespread Democratic opposition are likely to be dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Opponents of such measures argue that there are already election law safeguards in place that address these concerns. Those protections include that current law already bans noncitizen voting in federal elections and penalties can include jail time, deportation or denial of citizenship applications. Also, when people register to vote they swear under oath that they are citizens. RELATED: Trump’s claim that millions of immigrants are signing up to vote illegally is Pants on Fire!

What to know about the latest bird flu outbreaks,"April 12, 2024",Sara Swann,"Agriculture, Animals, Public Health","Recent U.S. outbreaks of avian influenza and the first known case of a human contracting bird flu from a mammal have ignited concerns that bird flu will be the next pandemic. Some social media users are claiming bird flu will be worse than COVID-19, which caused more than 1.2 million U.S. deaths since 2020. ""GET READY because the fabled ‘Disease X’ COVID PLANDEMIC 2.0 IS on the horizon, and it looks like it’s the ‘Avian Influenza’ Bird Flu H5N1 variant,"" an April 4 X post said. Another X post, featuring butchered grammar, said, ""Here we go …. Again. Scientists says Bird Flu pandemic could be ‘100 times worse’ than COVID."" Other X users said public health authorities are ""already working"" on a bird flu vaccine for humans, suggesting the disease outbreak was planned. Public health experts in the U.S. and worldwide say avian flu poses a low risk to humans, and there have been no signs of human-to-human spread of the disease. Developing a bird flu vaccine is part of the federal government’s pandemic preparedness. Avian influenza is a naturally occurring disease among wild birds, including ducks and geese, that can also infect domesticated birds, such as chickens and turkeys. Highly pathogenic strains of bird flu can cause severe infection and high fatality in birds. Low pathogenic strains trigger mild infections, but can turn highly pathogenic. Domesticated birds can contract avian flu through contact with infected birds, or through contact with surfaces contaminated with the virus. Because avian flu spreads quickly and is untreatable in animals, infected flocks are culled to prevent further infection. This strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, H5N1, was discovered in wild birds in the U.S. and Canada in late 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In 2022, the virus began causing outbreaks in commercial and backyard poultry. Since 2022, H5N1 bird flu has affected more than 82 million birds across almost every state, the CDC said. That means they live on premises where the flu has been detected. Sporadic infections of other wild animals, including bears, foxes and skunks, have also been reported. Recently, the virus spread to livestock for the first time. In March, U.S. officials reported that goats on a Minnesota farm tested positive for H5N1. Since then, the avian flu has also been detected in dairy cows in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas. At the beginning of April, the country’s largest egg producer, Cal-Maine Foods Inc., said it was temporarily halting production at a Texas plant after bird flu was found in its chickens. A Michigan poultry plant also reported bird flu infections. As of April 10, the U.S. Agriculture Department’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said avian flu affected more than 3.85 million birds in commercial and backyard flocks in Michigan, South Dakota and Texas over the past 30 days. It’s unusual for people to contract avian flu, but rare cases have occurred globally for nearly three decades, the CDC said. Infections can happen when the bird flu virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. The first bird flu outbreak among humans happened in 1997 in Hong Kong, and about 20 people were infected, the CDC said. No human cases were reported between 1998 and 2002, the CDC said. And since 2003, the World Health Organization said, there have been 889 cases of humans infected with bird flu across 23 countries, including the U.S., where two people have been diagnosed with the disease. The first U.S. case occurred in 2022 when a prison inmate caught the disease while killing infected poultry on a Colorado farm as part of a prerelease program. The person’s only symptom was fatigue and he recovered. On April 1, the second U.S. case of bird flu infection in a human was reported. The person who tested positive with the virus had been exposed to infected cows in Texas. The person, whose only reported symptom is eye redness, is being treated with an antiviral drug. Many social media users have raised alarm about the avian flu’s fatality rate for humans, with some citing ""scientists"" who said a bird flu pandemic could be ""100 times worse"" than COVID-19. This prediction appears to come from an April 3 Daily Mail article in which John Fulton, founder of Canada-based pharmaceutical company BioNiagara, said, ""This appears to be 100 times worse than Covid, or it could be if it mutates and maintains its high case fatality rate."" PolitiFact reached out to Fulton for comment, but didn’t hear back before publication. Of the people diagnosed with H5N1 avian flu worldwide since 1997, about 470, or 52%, have died, the WHO said. Bird flu infection numbers and fatality rates differ from country to country. Most of these bird flu infections were reported in Egypt and Indonesia before 2020, according to the WHO. The fatality rate for bird flu in Egypt is about 33%; in Indonesia, it’s 84%. The lower fatality rate in Egypt may be because the infections were less severe, detected early and treated better, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said. Claire Standley, an associate research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security who specializes in zoonotic diseases, said the severity of a disease depends on a myriad of factors, including a person’s previous exposure to the disease, underlying health conditions, age, access and quality of health care and exposure to the pathogen. It’s possible that mild or asymptomatic cases of bird flu in humans are not being detected or reported as well in low- and middle-income countries, ""so only those cases who are getting very sick are being picked up, along with their contacts — this is going to bias the case fatality data upwards, most likely,"" Standley said. ""My sense is that the claim of being ‘100 times worse’ than COVID is just an expression and is not based on a quantitative analysis,"" Standley said. Bird flu remains primarily an animal health issue and the risk to the general public remains low, the CDC said. The WHO also said the public health risk posed by this virus is low. Yes, there are bird flu vaccines in the federal government’s stockpile, but they are not available for sale. The CDC said vaccine manufacturers could use two candidate vaccine viruses to produce a H5N1 avian flu vaccine, if one was needed in an emergency. The current bird flu strain causing outbreaks in the U.S. is ""very closely related"" to these candidate vaccine viruses, the agency said. Viruses can change when they replicate after infection. The CDC has been monitoring the virus as outbreaks have occurred across the country. The agency’s preliminary analysis found that the virus remains ""primarily avian"" and ""not well adapted to people."" ""There were no changes that would make these viruses resistant to current FDA-approved and recommended flu antiviral medications,"" the CDC said. The Agriculture Department said poultry and eggs that are properly prepared and cooked to an internal temperature of 165° Fahrenheit are safe to eat. The chance of poultry affected by the avian flu entering the food supply is minuscule. The department’s Food Safety and Inspection Service personnel inspect poultry products intended for human consumption for signs of disease before the products enter the market. The department said it’s not concerned about the commercial milk supply’s safety because these products must be pasteurized before entering the market. Pasteurization heats dairy products to destroy any bacteria and viruses in them. Additionally, dairies must send only milk from healthy animals into processing for human consumption. Milk from avian flu-infected animals is diverted or destroyed so that it stays out of the human food supply, the department said. The FDA warns against consuming raw milk or unpasteurized dairy products because they can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can seriously threaten health."
"A fact-checker’s guide to Trump’s first criminal trial: business records, hush money and a gag order","April 11, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"National, Elections, Legal Issues","Amid a fiercely competitive 2024 election rematch against incumbent President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump will become the first former president put on criminal trial. Trump faces felony charges in four cases, but the first one to go to trial — and perhaps the only one likely to be completed before Nov. 5, Election Day — is a case in Manhattan concerning the alleged mislabeling of payments to adult film actor Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election. Daniels has said she had an affair with Trump. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment to Daniels made through Trump’s then-attorney Michael Cohen. (Daniels’ real name is Stephanie Clifford.) Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is prosecuting the case. Jury selection starts April 15. On its own, falsifying records in the second degree is a misdemeanor. However, the charge transforms into a felony if the person accused is convicted of falsifying business records with the intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal a crime committed. The upgrade would make the crimes Class E felonies, New York’s lowest level. ""Paying hush money is not illegal. People can disapprove of it, but it’s not illegal,"" said Jon Sale, a criminal defense attorney in Miami and a former Watergate prosecutor. Rather, Trump is accused of having made false entries in financial records to further another crime. ""Why did Donald Trump repeatedly make these false statements?"" Bragg said when he announced the charges. ""The evidence will show that he did so to cover up crimes relating to the 2016 election."" Bragg said Trump’s actions ""violated New York election law, which makes it a crime to conspire to promote a candidacy by unlawful means."" He also said the wire payment exceeded the federal campaign contribution cap and falsified financial statements violated New York law. The number of charges refers to 34 documents the grand jury found to have contained a ""critical false statement"" related to the payments. The counts also include documents related to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Trump, which Trump has consistently denied. Trump has three other active criminal cases: one Georgia case involving election interference, a separate federal case on election interference and a federal case on document retention. He has also faced a civil trial in New York over inflated valuations of his businesses. In that case, Trump was found liable but is appealing the verdict. Here, we will answer questions about the prosecution’s challenges and how the trial will work, and fact-check false and misleading statements Trump has made about the case.  Michael Cohen, former personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, leaves federal court Aug. 21, 2018, in New York. (AP) The Manhattan case may be the first to go to trial, but legal experts say it may be the hardest to prove. They cite three major challenges facing the prosecution. One is convincing a jury that the misdemeanor business falsification charges collectively advanced a separate crime, enabling Trump to be charged with a felony. ""A juror could easily have a reasonable doubt about whether the true motive behind the payments is … to keep your wife from finding out and protect your public image,"" said Bill Otis, former head of the Appellate Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia and a former special counsel to former President George H.W. Bush. A second challenge involves some key government witnesses, including Cohen, who was sentenced to three years in prison for tax evasion, making false statements to a federally insured bank and breaching campaign finance rules. Some charges he pleaded guilty to were related to the Daniels and McDougal cases. In a separate case, he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. Cohen eventually served a little more than a year in prison plus additional time on home confinement. This history means Cohen ""has serious credibility problems,"" said Matthew J. Galluzzo, who worked as a Manhattan prosecutor before Bragg’s tenure and is now in private practice. A third challenge for prosecutors is that it will take only one juror to prevent the unanimous verdict necessary to convict Trump. ""Even in a favorable venue like New York, some jurors could believe that Trump is being treated unfairly by our civil and criminal justice system,"" said Neama Rahmani, a former prosecutor who co-founded the firm West Coast Trial Lawyers. Adult film actor Stormy Daniels speaks April 16, 2018, outside federal court in New York. (AP) Citizen residents of Manhattan will comprise the jury. Even though Trump lived in the borough for much of his adult life, Manhattan probably is not a favorable jury pool for Trump: Biden won 86% of the vote there in 2020. During jury selection, attorneys on both sides will be able to ask potential jurors questions to see whether they have fixed notions about the case that would keep them from ruling impartially. The juror questionnaire posted by the court includes such questions as the prospective juror’s news and social media consumption habits; whether they have supported or belonged to  anti-government groups or identified as QAnon; whether they have attended a Trump rally or signed up for a pro-Trump newsletter; whether they have read his books; and whether they ""have any feelings of opinions about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case."" Sale said that even though the test is to put one’s beliefs aside ""and only decide based on the facts and the law,"" getting a fair jury will be a challenge for the defense. However, Trump’s ace in the hole is that he needs only one holdout. ""Mr. Trump is not going to find 12 jurors in Manhattan to unanimously acquit him,"" Galluzzo said. ""However, he wins, as a practical matter, if he can convince one juror out of 12 to have reasonable doubt."" If that happens, the judge would declare a mistrial, and it’s highly likely that Election Day, Nov. 5, will fall before the retrial. That outcome would benefit Trump. Former President Donald Trump salutes at a campaign rally March 16, 2024, in Vandalia, Ohio. (AP) The trial will be held every weekday except Wednesdays, when Juan M. Merchan, the acting justice of the Supreme Court, holds mental health court. New York law generally requires a defendant to be present during the trial, which, in this case, could last six to eight weeks. That schedule would mean that Trump can hold campaign events at night, on Wednesdays or on weekends. Trump can also continue posting on his Truth Social platform. Outwardly, Trump seems unfazed by the logistical constraints, often speaking to press gaggles after court appearances and using the trials to portray himself as a victim of the justice system. ""He is expected to use his trial as a major theme of his campaign,"" said Jerry Goldfeder, a senior counsel with the firm Cozen O’Connor who has represented elected officials. A week before the trial started, a Trump fundraising email said, ""Biden will raise millions while I’m stuck defending myself in court!"" and asked ""one million pro-Trump patriots to chip in."" A Class E felony is punishable by up to four years in prison, but even if Trump gets convicted, he might not get jail time. Being convicted of a felony is no barrier to running for president or serving. Even being in prison would not block him from serving as president, though it might cause significant logistical headaches. Trump omits that the order still allows him to criticize key people with power in the prosecution. Merchan’s April 1 gag order barred Trump from speaking about witnesses or counsel in the case other than Bragg or about members of the court staff or their family members if those statements are made to interfere with the case. In other words, Trump can still criticize Bragg and Merchan. Even though the federal government is not prosecuting Trump in this case, Trump also maintains his right to call it a ""Biden trial."" Trump’s lawyers have challenged the gag order and courts will have the final say. Legal experts agreed that Trump should not be allowed to make comments that incite violence, But beyond that, we heard mixed opinions about the gag order. Sale said one potentially unfair aspect of the order is that although Cohen has frequently talked about the case on television, outside of court, Trump cannot rebut what Cohen says. However, experts said the law supports gag orders. ""This case law goes back decades,"" said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law, ""Merchan followed it."" Duncan Levin, who worked in the district attorney’s office before Bragg and is now a defense attorney, agreed with Gillers. Gag orders ""with very limited exceptions have long been found not to violate the First Amendment,"" Levin said. Trump ""is free to discuss the criminal justice system but not to make ad hominem attacks on particular people associated with the case,"" Levin said. The First Amendment does not protect all speech, said Steven Friedland, an Elon University law professor and former assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. ""Political speech and ideas are the most highly protected, although they are still not without limits,"" Friedland said. ""The judge is attempting to protect political speech while at the same time protecting the fair administration of justice."" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg speaks April 4, 2023, at a press conference after former president Donald Trump’s arraignment in New York. (AP) This statement by Trump on Truth Social is unsupported. Trump points to one of Bragg’s prosecutors, Matthew Colangelo, who formerly worked for the Justice Department and the New York attorney general. ""Colangelo is a radical left (prosecutor) from the DOJ who was put into the state working for (New York Attorney General) Letitia James and was then put into the district attorney's office to run the trial against Trump,"" Trump said during a March press conference. While working for the New York attorney general, Colangelo investigated the Trump Foundation and led lawsuits against the Trump administration. But his presence on the team doesn’t prove that Biden White House or campaign officials coordinated the case with Bragg. Although some legal experts told PolitiFact that Bragg could have avoided controversy by not hiring Colangelo, they agreed that his hiring does not signal that the White House or campaign officials coordinated with the district attorney’s office. Galluzzo called Trump’s statement ""total nonsense."" ""Why would it be strange or suspicious for a prosecutor to hire another prosecutor with a New York license and experience working on complex prosecutorial matters?"" Galluzzo said. ""Most federal prosecutors in this country have worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations."" Days before the trial, Trump wrote on Truth Social ""look what was just found! Will the fake news report it?"" and showed a Jan. 30, 2018, letter by Daniels stating ""I am denying this affair because it never happened."" The letter was publicly released and widely reported on the day it was released. But soon after, Daniels recanted, saying an affair had in fact occurred. She said her denials were because of a nondisclosure agreement and that she signed the letter because parties involved ""made it sound like I had no choice."" PolitiFact in 2023 fact-checked a claim that the 2018 letter ""debunked"" Bragg’s case and rated that False.

Inaccurate data used to show cost-of-living increases between Trump and Biden presidencies,"April 5, 2024",Sofia Ahmed,"National, Economy, Facebook Fact-checks","Was the cost of living lower during Donald Trump’s tenure or Joe Biden’s current presidency? A graphic shared on social media tries to answer that question, but its data needs a second look. The Facebook image showed two columns: a red one labeled ""HOW IT STARTED"" for costs on the last day of Trump’s presidency and a blue one labeled ""HOW IT’S GOING"" for costs during Biden’s presidency ""today."" According to the graphic, inflation, gasoline prices, mortgage rates, grocery prices and electricity costs have spiked while the Nasdaq composite stock index and ""real average hourly earnings"" have dropped. ""Just in case you’re sitting on the fence,"" words atop the March 10 graphic said, followed by an eye-rolling emoji. This post was flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.)  (Screenshot from Facebook) The post does not identify the graphic data’s source, although a watermark at the bottom says ""Tom Tiffany."" On Sep. 28, 2022, U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., shared the same graphic on his X account. It doesn’t accurately reflect what was happening as of January 2021 or March 2024, as the post claims. Although many consumer prices have risen under Biden’s administration, as of March 10, many of the figures in the post were inaccurate. The graphic is close to reflecting  what was happening in 2021 but its 2024 figure is wrong. The inflation rate was about 1.4% when Trump left office and peaked in summer 2022, with Biden as president, reaching about 9% that June. But, by February 2024, the most recent month with available data, the inflation rate was 3.2%, well below the 8.3% claimed in the post. These numbers are slightly off. The nationwide average gasoline price in January 2021 was $2.42 per gallon, weekly U.S. Energy Information Administration data shows. For the week ending March 11, the average price of a gallon of gasoline was $3.49. This is not far off, but it underrepresents the mortgage rate when Trump left office and overstates what it was in early March. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which gathers weekly mortgage loan data, reported the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was at 2.77% when Trump left office and 6.88% on March 7. The government does not track average national rental prices, but the claim differs from data collected by rental companies. A market report by Rent, a rental company, found that across the 50 largest cities in America,  the national average rental price in February 2024 was $1,981 and in January 2021 was $1,639. Data from the Apartment List, another website that helps renters find apartments, said that the average national median rent price in February was $1,377 and $1,144 in January 2021. The website’s estimates project rental prices in the future by using data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey about people who have recently moved. Both data sets found that there has been a roughly 18% increase in rent prices between February and the end of Trump’s presidency, not a 23% increase as the post claims. The site shows that the average rent hasn’t exceeded $2,000 since 2017. In We aren’t sure what time period the post refers to but food prices have risen under Biden along with consumer prices. Overall food prices increased by 5.3% under Trump’s presidency and by 20.4% during Biden’s first three years in office, previous PolitiFact reporting found. Biden’s administration so far has seen larger increases in electricity prices than did Trump’s. During Trump’s presidency, the national average household electricity price rose by 4.22%, while it has risen by 30% so far under Biden, data by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. CLAIM: Nasdaq was up 13,342 points when Trump left office and is now down 10,829 points. This is way off. The Nasdaq composite stock index rose by 7,641 points between the first and last days of the Trump presidency. But the Nasdaq hasn’t fallen during Biden’s presidency; as of March 24, it was up by about 3,231 points. Median weekly inflation-adjusted wages for full-time workers increased by nearly 6% during Trump’s presidency, and although they’ve fallen under Biden, the current decline, about half a percent, is smaller than the post says. Given recent trends, the change under Biden is poised to return to zero and then turn positive within months. PolitiFact has found that price changes are affected by factors other than who is in office, such as Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, global oil price swings and the coronavirus pandemic.

"Two ships colliding with bridges in the same week? That’s not unusual, reports show","April 4, 2024",Jeff Cercone,"National, Transportation","After Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge was struck by a cargo ship and collapsed, some social media users sensed that something sinister was afoot. Video of the March 26 Baltimore accident showed a massive container ship lose power and strike one of the bridge’s piers, knocking the 47-year-old structure into the Patapsco River. The shocking video was widely shared on social media, with many people claiming without evidence that the collapse was a terrorist attack, although Maryland and federal officials have said there’s no evidence that it was anything more than an accident. But now it seems some people are on the lookout for bridge-related incidents, drawing larger conclusions from what they suggest is a suspicious trend. ""Maybe it’s just a coincidence,"" one Facebook user wrote after a barge hit an Oklahoma bridge March 30. ""2nd bridge struck in less than a week. What is going on?"" asked an Instagram user, referring to the same Oklahoma incident. Other people on Facebook and TikTok shared a photo of the Baltimore bridge with the words, ""3 major bridges in 1 day. All just a coincidence right?"" Those posts tied Baltimore with incidents involving the Valley View Bridge in Ohio and the Indian River Inlet Bridge in Delaware, with some of them showing screenshots of news articles. But these posts draw a connection to the Baltimore accident that doesn’t exist, and exaggerate what happened in Oklahoma, Ohio and Delaware. In Oklahoma, a barge struck a bridge March 30 over the Arkansas River near the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, forcing officials to close U.S. Highway 59 south of Sallisaw for a few hours while the damage was inspected. Damage to the bridge was superficial and the road reopened after a few hours, according to news reports. Officials have not announced the accident’s cause. In Valley View, Ohio, a pile of raw wood materials at a landscape supply company caught fire March 26 at a site adjacent to the Valley View Bridge, which holds Interstate 480 lanes. The bridge itself was not damaged, and the highway never closed during the fire, state and local officials told PolitiFact. There was nothing suspicious about the fire, officials said. In Delaware, nature was to blame: Beach erosion combined with high tide and a coastal storm led to waves breaching sand dunes March 26 and flooding lanes of a highway just north of the Indian River Inlet Bridge, according to news reports and social media posts from the Delaware Department of Transportation. News photos showed flooding on the roads where the dunes were breached, but no damage or flooding on the bridge itself. The flurry of attention these incidents received overlook how frequently ships or barges run into bridges. U.S. Department of Transportation data shows there were 621,581 roadway bridges (over land and water) in 2023. The wreckage of the Amtrak Sunset Limited train is seen Sept. 22, 1993, after it derailed minutes after a barge hit a railroad bridge north of Mobile, Ala. Forty-seven people were killed. We found no federal data tracking such accidents, but a 2018 report for PIANC: The World Association for Waterborne Transit Infrastructure showed that from 1960 to 2015, there were 35 major bridge collapses worldwide — events in which structures collapsed and/or lives were lost — because of ship or barge collisions, killing 342 people. Eighteen of those happened in the U.S., the report said. Among those prominent accidents are: The Big Bayou Canot railroad bridge near Mobile, Alabama: In 1993, a barge lost in dense fog crashed into a railroad bridge, displacing it. Moments later, an Amtrak train derailed on the displaced bridge, killing 47 people and injuring 103 others. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay, Florida: The bridge collapsed in 1980 after it was struck by a freighter. Thirty-five people died in that collapse, many of whom were riding a Greyhound bus that fell into the water. The Interstate 40 bridge in Oklahoma: In 2002, a barge struck a support beam in this bridge near Webbers Falls, sending a 580-foot section of the bridge, and several cars and trucks, into the Arkansas River below. Fourteen people died, local news reported. The Queen Isabella Causeway bridge in Texas: Pilot error was to blame after a barge struck a pillar of the bridge in Port Isabel, causing it to collapse in September 2001. Eight people died. Not all ship or barge collisions with bridges result in bridge collapses or loss of life, and reports show minor collisions are fairly common. The 2018 report said that during a two-week period in January 2016, there were six barge collisions with highway and rail bridges crossing the Mississippi River because of floodwater conditions. A separate 2003 U.S. Coast Guard report found towing vessels and barges collided with bridges in U.S. waters 2,682 times from 1992 to 2001. Given the number of tugboat and towboat trips each year, the report said, that means collisions with bridges happened at a rate of 0.06% — or six collisions for every 10,000 boat trips. The Coast Guard report said human errors are the ""predominant factor"" in bridge collisions. Michael Knott, a vice president at Moffatt & Nichol, a global infrastructure advisory company, declined to be interviewed because his company is working with federal and Maryland transportation agencies involved in the Baltimore accident. But Knott co-wrote the 2018 PIANC report and gave a 2016 presentation in Maryland to the Baltimore Structural Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers. The presentation noted more than 250 minor vessel collisions with bridges each year in the U.S., averaging about five per week. Accidents are because of pilot error, mechanical failure or adverse environmental conditions, the presentation said. To see how common these incidents are, we also searched the Coast Guard Maritime Information Exchange Incident Investigation Reports using the keyword ""bridge."" Results showed 74 reports of bridge collisions with vessels in a one-year period (April 3, 2023, to April 3, 2024). That’s an average of about six per month. Many incidents happened within days of one another, and the entries with detailed information show most were minor incidents, although many were still listed as under review. For example, on April 11, 2023, a towing vessel collided with a railroad bridge on the Black Warrior River in Alabama. No damage was found on the vessel or bridge, the report said. A separate report on the same day shows the same bridge was struck by another vessel. The bridge was minimally damaged, the report said. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report."
"How paid X accounts blamed Israel, Ukraine for the Baltimore bridge collapse","April 3, 2024",Madison Czopek,"Israel, Technology, Ukraine, Russia","At 1:29 a.m. March 26, the Dali, a large container ship, struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, causing its collapse. Within hours — as many Americans slept — misinformers on X and other platforms posted wild theories, unsubstantiated claims and speculation about who was to blame for the catastrophe. Without evidence, misinformers coalesced around the idea that the bridge collapsed because of a coordinated attack. PolitiFact repeatedly saw social media users falsely assign blame to two nations: Israel and Ukraine. ""If you’re pro-Russia and anti-Ukraine, then it was a Ukrainian attack,"" said Mike Rothschild, a journalist and conspiracy theory expert who has written books about conspiracy theories. As of April 1, there have been no credible reports or evidence that the ship’s collision with the bridge was linked to terrorism or an attack. Nevertheless, the invented narratives proliferated — often customized to suit individual posters’ preexisting beliefs and brands, researchers said. Sara Aniano, a disinformation analyst at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, said these claims often came from people who make it their literal business to spread conspiracy theories. ""A content creator who does makeup tutorials is not much different than the content creator who is selling conspiracy theories,"" Aniano said. ""These theories and these events are the equivalent of their products."" We found that X subscribers paying for blue check marks that guarantee greater reach from the platform’s algorithm were responsible for nearly all of the most popular posts linking Israel or Ukraine to the bridge collapse. X promotes subscribers’ posts even if they contain unverified or false information. The platform also shares ad revenue with ""blue-check"" subscribers, letting them earn profit when people interact with their posts. Misinformation experts said bridge collapse conspiracy theories were widespread and also successfully reached a larger, more mainstream audience on X. PolitiFact used advanced searches on X to analyze more than 100 posts and create a timeline of the anti-Ukraine and anti-Israel narratives that emerged immediately following the incident. Misinformation experts also shared some examples with us. Here’s our timeline of the day’s events and examples of anti-Ukraine and anti-Israel claims: 1:29 a.m. The Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed. 3:02 a.m. The earliest posts mentioning Ukraine or Israel did not immediately assign blame, but brought both countries into the bridge collapse discussion. ""Collapse of a Bridge in Baltimore after being hit by a ship. US infrastructures emblematic of a declining/collapsing empire,"" one paid X subscriber posted. ""Money spent in endless wars, to finance Nazis in Ukraine and baby killers in Gaza rather than taking care of US citizens."" 3:22 a.m. A paid X user with 185,000 followers and a Russian flag emoji in its name asked, ""Did Israel just hit the US over not using the Veto power yesterday?"" The U.S. on March 25 abstained from voting on a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Three times prior, the U.S. vetoed similar resolutions.

Resolution on the Gaza ceasefire,"" wrote a blue-check subscriber whose bio includes a Russian flag before the words ""defeat NATO."" ""And the U.S. didn’t send Ukraine the $60 billion."" Some posts sharing anti-Ukraine or anti-Israel sentiment came from accounts that declared support for the conservative ""MAGA"" movement or used language linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory. Pro-Russia accounts also promoted these narratives. The 3:22 a.m. X post that questioned whether Israel ""hit"" the U.S. came from a user NewsGuard analyst Coalter Palmer described as a ""notorious purveyor of misinformation related to the Russia Ukraine war."" Palmer pointed to two other X posts in which that user falsely claimed the Bucha massacre was a false flag operation and that Ukraine is a ""Nazi state."" Memetica, a digital investigations company that studies disinformation and violent extremism, found that the false Ukrainian ship captain claim was pushed by pro-Russia accounts and QAnon conspiracy theory promoters, said Adi Cohen the company’s chief operating officer. Looking at a sample of X posts from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. March 26, Cohen said Memetica found that 7% of the accounts sharing that narrative had zero followers, suggesting what researchers call ""inauthentic amplification"" — accounts created solely to boost the narrative. Cohen said that the Ukrainian captain claim was promoted by a known element of the Russian disinformation ecosystem, SouthFront, a website the State Department described in a 2020 report as ""a multilingual online disinformation site registered in Russia."" Most researchers identified Telegram, 4Chan and X as places where this misinformation flourished most, crediting those platforms’ permissive policies about what can be posted and X’s reputation as the go-to platform to discuss breaking news events. It’s hard to definitively say where misinformation was worst, because not every platform shares the same data or is easily searchable, experts said. Conspiratorial content might have been more contained to fringe platforms once, but such theories are now widespread on platforms including X and TikTok, said the ADL’s Aniano. Memetica analysts observed conspiratorial content about the bridge collapse right away on all social media platforms, but especially X, Telegram and TikTok, Cohen said. Misinformers can use events like the bridge collapse as ""another plot point in their broader narrative that the mainstream media is not to be trusted, that our government is not to be trusted, that experts like us are not to be trusted, and that there is always an active attack against America happening,"" Aniano said.  In this image taken from video released by the National Transportation and Safety Board, the cargo ship Dali is stuck under part of the structure of the Francis Scott Key Bridge after the ship hit the bridge, March 26, 2024, in Baltimore. (AP) Once misinformers seize on an event, experts said, they often assign blame to entities — people, groups, countries — that have also been in recent news headlines. ""Given that the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine are ongoing and continued funding to support these various efforts remains a major wedge issue in the United States, it makes sense that they would become fodder for conspiracies and false claims,"" said Valerie Wirtschafter, a Brookings Institution fellow in foreign policy and the artificial intelligence and emerging technology initiative. Wirtschafter said she suspects this ""will likely continue to be the way that these types of narratives take shape — by leveraging prominent and polarizing political topics in times of uncertainty and incomplete information.""

"'An environment of distrust': How Elon Musk amplifies falsehoods about immigration, 2024 voting","April 2, 2024",Amy Sherman,"Immigration, National, Elections","A video viewed by millions of users on X details an elaborate scheme to grab power by President Joe Biden and prominent Democrats. The video shows people racing to the U.S. by land, air and sea and flashes headshots of men of color. The narrator warns that the federal government wants to keep them ""in the country at all costs,"" even if they committed rape or murder. Mail ballots sit in overstuffed bins as the narrator warns noncitizens can vote without verification. ""This is actually happening!"" wrote Elon Musk, the owner of X. It’s not. There is no evidence of the Biden administration importing immigrants so that Democrats win elections. In the last three months, Musk has flooded X with about two dozen posts that speak to that central conspiracy theory. Here’s a sampling of his false or misleading posts about immigrants and voting, fact-checked: Musk said ""illegals are not prevented from voting in federal elections."" (Federal law says only U.S. citizens can vote in presidential and congressional elections.) Musk said automatic voter registration includes ""no citizenship verification"" and ballots are mailed out, ""making fraud traceability impossible."" (States take steps to ensure registrants are U.S. citizens and election officials take steps to prevent voter fraud. Ballots cast by noncitizens are extremely rare; violators could face jail time or be deported if they are in the country illegally.) Musk said migrants will give Democrats more seats in Congress, a step toward one-party rule. (Two reports published before the 2020 census projected that not counting immigrants in the country illegally would basically have been a wash, favoring neither party.) Musk said a bipartisan border security bill’s long-term goal was ""enabling illegals to vote"" and would do the ""opposite of securing the border."" (The bill included funding for border agents and security. It did not give people in the U.S. illegally voting power nor did it include a path to citizenship.) Musk accused the Biden administration of ""importing voters"" who are ""unvetted"" and pose a national security threat, saying ""it is highly probable that the groundwork is being laid for something far worse than 9/11."" Factually speaking, there are high-profile cases of immigrants in the U.S. illegally being charged with crimes, including murder. But research shows that immigrants are no more likely to commit crimes than people born in the U.S. A 2023 Stanford University study found immigrants are 30% less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the U.S. Musk told former CNN host Don Lemon that immigrants in the country illegally have a ""very strong bias to vote Democrat,"" though he neither explained what he had read to reach this conclusion, nor cited any examples. Election officials who have seen these claims for years say fears of noncitizen voting are overblown and ignore states’ safeguards to prevent and detect fraud. ""Tying immigration policy to election security is like the sleight of hand a magician uses to trick voters into seeing something that's not there,"" said Amanda Gonzalez, Jefferson County, Colorado, clerk and recorder. With reshared posts and riffs, Musk joins former President Donald Trump as a top voice sowing doubt about the 2024 election’s integrity amid historic levels of border encounters. (Musk has not endorsed Trump but said in March, ""We need a red wave or America is toast."" ""It seeds the ground and continues to build a foundation for more and more people to deny election results that they don’t like and therefore engage in a violent assault on our democracy because of it,"" said Zachary Mueller, senior research director for America’s Voice, a pro-immigrant group. ""I don’t think that’s hyperbolic. We have seen that on January 6."" Our efforts to reach Musk through Tesla, SpaceX and X’s press or investor offices were met with no response or automated replies. Musk has leveraged his influence to boost a specific type of migrant footage: short and out of context. Content creator Nick Shirley, 21, has made national headlines by interviewing migrants who have crossed the border and arrived in cities such as Denver. His mom, Brooke Shirley, holds the camera as he asks questions in Spanish. On Feb. 5, Nick Shirley shared a 22-second video of his conversations, writing on X: ""Confirmed: Migrants for Biden 2024."" The framing makes it look like the migrants told him they intend to vote for Biden in this election. The details are less certain: Nick Shirley asks, ""Do you have the right to vote?"" According to Shirley’s subtitle, one man replies, ""Those that entered legally, have access to vote."" PolitiFact’s bilingual journalists, with native Spanish fluency, listened to the man’s intonation and heard him asking a question: ""If we entered illegally, do we have the right to vote?"" The clip doesn’t show whether Shirley answered the man’s question. The clip then shows a different angle of Shirley and the man (and other people around them), and Shirley asking:""Who are you going to vote for?"" Biden, they said. But the YouTube version of Shirley’s interview shows him asking longer questions with caveats such as ""And if you could vote, who would you vote for,"" and ""If you have the privilege to vote, who are you going to vote for?"" The X version caught the attention of Collin Rugg, co-owner of the conservative Trending Politics website. He shared it to more than 960,000 followers on X, compared with Shirley’s 11,500. Musk replied to Rugg a half-hour later with a simple ""!"" ""It’s all part of the plan,"" Rugg responded. Other influential accounts shared the video, and Shirley appeared on Fox News. Musk ""helps share information faster than anyone else on the platform,"" Nick Shirley told PolitiFact. ""My videos have been seen by millions of people."" The Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington used this example to show a pattern: Someone such as Shirley produces video evidence. News brokers such as Rugg use it to make claims about noncitizen voting. High-profile users such as Musk share the posts to their massive audiences. ""That story tells us about how evidence does not change the narrative,"" said Mert Can Bayar, postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington. ""The narrative defines the evidence."" The Center for an Informed Public counts Rugg among a new wave of accounts that have grown politically influential since Musk bought Twitter in October 2022. Musk’s interest in election integrity ignores new or proposed safeguards to prevent fraudulent voting. He posted multiple times in early February when Senate leaders introduced a border security bill. The legislation, co-written by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., died quickly after Trump denounced it, scuttling its chances of broad Republican support. ""The long-term goal of the so-called ‘Border Security’ bill is enabling illegals to vote!"" Musk wrote. Noncitizens — which includes people legally and illegally in the U.S. — can’t vote in federal elections. The path to U.S. citizenship can take a decade. The current influx of immigrants would not lead to a significant number of new voters for many years, if ever. Musk later said Democrats ""won’t deport"" immigrants in the U.S. illegally because each is likely to vote for Democrats ""at some point."" But Democratic-led administrations have deported millions of immigrants. Musk has warned that U.S. citizens don’t realize their votes will be ""rendered meaningless,"" linking to a Joe Rogan podcast clip about New York City allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections. A judge struck down that law in 2022, so it’s not in effect. A small number of cities in blue states allow noncitizen voting for local contests. Takoma Park, Maryland, has allowed noncitizen voting for mayor and city council since 1993. About 200 noncitizens are registered to vote in elections compared with 11,200 registered citizen voters in Takoma Park. Voting for local elections is held on a separate ballot and location from state and federal elections. Jessie Carpenter, Takoma Park clerk, said if a noncitizen showed up at a polling precinct site to vote in a state or federal election, that person would not be on the roll of eligible voters. ""There is no basis for thinking these folks would be voting in state elections,"" Carpenter said. Promoting claims that immigrants will replace U.S.-born Americans, including at the ballot box, stretches back to the 19th century; in the 1850s, the Know-Nothing Party tried to ban immigrants from voting. What’s new in this era is how influencers such as Musk and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson portray this apparent new-immigrant influence as an assault from the outside, said Casey Ryan Kelly, an expert on political extremism and communication studies professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. They portray it as not just the result of demographic forces, but deliberate motivation by Democratic politicians, Kelly said. ""It’s more concerning now because of the ability to spread more quickly outside a small group of white supremacists,"" Kelly said. About 40 states allowed noncitizens to vote at some point between 1776 and 1926. By allowing noncitizens to vote in local, state and federal elections and run for office, leaders hoped to enable civic education and immigrants’ citizenship, said Ron Hayduk, a San Francisco State University political science professor. In 1996, Congress banned noncitizen voting in federal elections as part of a broader toughening of penalties for people in the country illegally. Since then, there have been rare cases of noncitizens voting — though not enough to swing elections. In 2020, federal prosecutors charged 19 people in North Carolina with voter fraud after they cast ballots mostly in the 2016 election. Sixteen people pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors related to voting as a noncitizen; three cases were dismissed. More than 4.5 million people in North Carolina voted in the 2016 presidential election. Musk’s citizenship journey seems to inform his views. Born in South Africa in 1971, Musk has said his goal as a child was to get to the United States. He became a U.S. citizen in 2002 after living in Canada, graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and launching businesses, including the online bank that became PayPal. As one of Earth’s richest men, Musk’s voice extends far beyond the X platform. His posts reach other audiences on Instagram, TikTok and conservative news outlets with millions of viewers. Some people discount such narratives by politicians, but Musk’s not being a politician adds ""a level of legitimacy,"" said Mueller of America’s Voice. Musk often shares posts by viral accounts, but Musk told Lemon that if he quotes something ""it doesn’t mean I agree with everything in it"" and that he views it as something ""people should consider."" It’s possible to read his posts and reach the conclusion  that states fail to ensure that only citizens cast ballots. ""Many states automatically register anyone with a driver’s license to vote (no citizenship verification), ballots are then mailed out and ‘ballot harvesters’ pick them up (and) mail them in, making fraud traceability impossible,"" Musk wrote Feb. 5. About half of U.S. states have automatic voter registration in which eligible people are registered to vote when they conduct other government business, often at the motor vehicles department. But they can opt out, and still must be citizens to register to vote. The rest of Musk’s post makes several leaps; people who register this way do not necessarily vote by mail and ask someone else to return their ballot. Musk ignores that state laws vary over who can drop off mail ballots and how many. Amanda López Askin, the local elections official in Doña Ana County, New Mexico, a border community, said when people ask how the county protects voter rolls, she points to the protections such as voter registration ID requirements and New Mexico’s voter registration form. It warns that if a person is not a citizen, ""do not complete this form."" ""I have a hard time believing there are huddles of undocumented people that are determined to commit a fourth-degree felony for one vote,"" López Askin told PolitiFact. Fraudulent voter registration or voting by noncitizens often results from misunderstandings or errors. Nationwide, states check databases to verify citizenship status, although those efforts are imperfect. Colorado’s voter registration system compares state and federal data to find matches before registering voters. If the system finds no match, residents must show an eligible ID before they can vote. Musk’s words create ""an environment of distrust,"" said Denver Clerk Paul López. ""It’s important for people to know that voter registration is secure, and eligibility is verified through several mechanisms,"" López said. ""Disinformation is dangerous to migrants, election officials, and is overall unhealthy for our democracy.""

Baltimore bridge collapse: Why the federal government is paying upfront to fix it,"April 2, 2024",Jeff Cercone,"National, Congress, Transportation","After President Joe Biden said the federal government would pay to replace Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge, a project estimated to cost from $400 million to over $1 billion, some social media users questioned why the company that owned the ship isn’t footing the bill. Biden, in March 26 remarks after the accident, said the federal government ""will pay for the entire cost of reconstructing that bridge,"" and he expected congressional support for that effort. On social media, users expressed outrage. ""That ship was commissioned by a Danish company. It was operating under a Singapore flag … President Biden thinks the American taxpayers should foot the bill to clean up the mess and rebuild the bridge. I think there’s a foreign company that owes us a bridge!"" read three Facebook posts that shared the same graphic. ""Why are WE responsible for paying for this!! Make it make sense!!"" another Facebook post said. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., criticized Biden, writing in an X post, ""Why add a billion dollars to US debt when the big insurance companies exist for precisely this purpose?"" The ship that struck the bridge was owned by Singapore-based company Grace Ocean Private Ltd. It was managed by Singapore-based ship management company Synergy Marine Group and chartered by Danish shipping company Maersk. Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and Synergy Marine Group filed a court petition April 1 seeking to cap their liability at about $43.6 million. The federal Department of Transportation on March 28 announced $60 million in ""quick release"" Emergency Relief funds for the Maryland Department of Transportation Department to begin rebuilding the bridge, describing it as an ""initial down payment of funds."" Getting the bridge repaired and the Port of Baltimore open to ship traffic is an economic imperative for Maryland and for the U.S., Maryland and federal officials said. The bridge carried more than 30,000 vehicles a day, state officials said. The Port of Baltimore in 2021 was the 17th largest in the U.S. for annual total tonnage of cargo, U.S. Department of Transportation data shows. Maryland’s Democratic governor, Wes Moore, said March 31 on ""Fox News Sunday"" that the bridge collapse isn’t affecting Maryland’s economy alone, but also states across the country. The support Baltimore has received ""isn’t because anyone is trying to do Maryland a favor,"" Moore said. ""It’s because the national economy relies on the Port of Baltimore being up and running,"" The federal government stepping in to pay to rebuild the bridge doesn’t necessarily mean taxpayers will cover the entire bill. When reporters asked Biden March 26 whether the company that owned the ship should be held responsible, Biden said, ""That could be, but we’re not going to wait if that happened. We’re going to pay for it to get the bridge rebuilt and open."" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at a March 27 news briefing that ""any private party that is found responsible and liable will be held accountable"" for the bridge accident. Analysts say insured losses including for bridge repair and business interruption could amount to up to $4 billion. But lawsuits in similar disasters have taken years to settle. Peter Knudson, a National Transportation Safety Board spokesperson, said its investigation is expected to last one to two years. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said on ABC’s ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" that ""The federal government will pay 90% of the costs,"" and he plans to introduce legislation to cover the other 10%. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a March 27 MSNBC interview, said money from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law could help pay some of the costs, but said she expected insurance to cover those costs partly. Buttigieg said March 31 on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" that more than the initial $60 million in emergency released funding will come, but ""it is possible we may need to turn to Congress to supplement that fund. That has happened in the past."" Although some Republicans in Congress have expressed opposition to paying for the repairs, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in an April 1 radio interview that the federal government will pay ""the lion’s share"" of the cost to replace the bridge. Buttigieg pointed to bipartisan support for a $250 million reconstruction package following the 2007 collapse of the Interstate N35 in Minnesota. The bridge’s August 2007 collapse near downtown Minneapolis took down 111 vehicles, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The NTSB concluded that the probable cause was ""inadequate load capacity, due to a design error"" of some of the bridge’s structures. With the state estimated to lose about $60 million in economic output in 2007 and 2008 because of the bridge’s absence, Congress three days after the bridge’s collapse authorized the reconstruction funding. Two days after that, former President George W. Bush signed it into law. The bridge was completed in 13 months. URS Corp., the engineering company tasked to evaluate the bridge before it collapsed, agreed to pay $52.4 million to the tragedy’s victims. Steve Ellis, president of the Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending, said the federal government often intervenes after disasters to pay for the immediate response. ""In this case, where there are other insured actors, like the shipping line, the federal government should go after them for reimbursement and penalties,"" Ellis said. Andy Winkler, director of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s infrastructure project, said the Biden administration’s quick offer of assistance in the Baltimore bridge collapse does not preclude the federal government from recouping costs should a private sector party be found responsible. Here are some examples of the federal government paying up front and seeking reimbursement later: A plume of smoke rises April 21, 2010, from fires on BP's Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. (AP) Deepwater Horizon and Exxon Valdez oil spills: Ellis and Winkler each pointed to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and Ellis also noted the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska as examples of the federal government contributing to upfront costs and recovering moneymore through settlements with the companies responsible. Those settlements took six years to reach in the Deepwater spill and two in the Exxon spill. The Deepwater spill, triggered by an oil rig explosion that killed 11 people, was the largest U.S. marine oil spill ever, releasing about 130 million gallons of oil into the sea and soiling five states coastlines. The federal government reached a $20.8 billion settlement with BP, the largest environmental settlement in U.S. history, that was approved in 2016 by a federal judge. ""The federal government provided assistance, including funding to support cleanup efforts, all while aggressively pursuing compensation for all damage,"" Winkler said. Before Deepwater Horizon, the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill had been the worst in U.S. history. An Exxon oil tanker struck a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil into the water. Exxon agreed to pay $1 billion in fines and damages, the Enviromental Protection Agency said in 1991. Overall, Exxon said it has paid $4.3 billion after the accident in compensatory and cleanup payments, settlements and fines. A black plume rises over East Palestine, Ohio, on Feb. 6, 2023, as a result of the controlled detonation of a portion of the derailed Norfolk Southern trains. (AP) East Palestine train derailment: In 2023, after a train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, the state led the initial emergency operation with federal and local support. Days later, the EPA ordered its operator, Norfolk Southern, to reimburse the agency for cleanup. Norfolk Southern claimed that companies responsible for the destroyed tank cars and spilled chemicals should share cleanup costs, which it said amounted to more than $1.1 billion. But in March, a federal judge ruled that solely Norfolk Southern should fund the cleanup. The $1.1 billion figure reflects any costs charged to Norfolk because of the derailment, along with the more than $104 million paid directly to residents and the East Palestine community, Norfolk spokesperson Connor Spielmaker told PolitiFact. The EPA told PolitiFact in an April 1 email it will send Norfolk Southern a bill for all of its personnel, time and resources spent. Washington highway bridge collapse: In Washington state in May 2013, the Interstate 5 Skagit River Bridge in Mount Vernon, about halfway between Seattle and the Canadian border, collapsed after a wide-load-bearing 18-wheeler crashed into the bridge. A month later, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration released $15.6 million from emergency funds to pay for the repairs, but required the state to seek reimbursement, The Seattle Times reported. In 2019, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that Mullen Trucking and Motorways Trucking, the  two companies responsible for the crash, were responsible for paying $17 million to pay the repair costs instead of taxpayers, The Seattle Times said.

"Transgender Day of Visibility always falls on March 31. This year, so did Easter.","April 1, 2024",Grace Abels,"LGBTQ, Religion","On March 29, the Biden White House proclaimed March 31, 2024, as Transgender Day of Visibility. This move prompted outrage from social media users and political figures upset that Easter, which fell on the same day, had been ""replaced"" or overwritten.  

""Banning sacred truth and tradition —while at the same time proclaiming Easter Sunday as ""Transgender Day""—is outrageous and abhorrent,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., posted on X. 

The claims swirling across social media missed a lot of context. It is a coincidence that Easter and Transgender Day of Visibility fell on the same day this year, and President Joe Biden released a statement for Easter, too.

Transgender Day of Visibility, a day dedicated to raising awareness about the transgender community, has been on March 31 every year since its creation more than a decade ago. It is a fixed date like the Fourth of July, Veterans Day or Christmas. President Joe Biden issued a similar ""proclamation"" for March 31 in 2023, 2022 and 2021. Biden also declared March 31, 2024 César Chávez Day to honor the labor activist famous for organizing farmworkers.

But Easter’s date changes each year. The Christian holiday celebrating Jesus Christ’s resurrection is also observed by children with chocolate bunnies and egg hunts. It fell on March 31 this year. In 2023, it fell on April 9, and the year before, on April 17. Easter’s date is based on the lunar calendar and always falls on the Sunday following the first full moon after the spring equinox. Other roving holidays, such as Thanksgiving or Memorial Day, are based on a certain week in a given month. In 2025, Easter will fall on April 20, a day often associated with smoking marijuana.

By issuing a ""proclamation"" for Transgender Day of Visibility this year, Biden did not replace or change Easter.

""As a Christian who celebrates Easter with family, President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American,"" said Andrew J. Bates, White House deputy press secretary.

Here’s another holiday for the April calendar: International Fact-Checking Day on April 2!"
"Do Jesse Watters’ claims about the federal budget, LGBTQ+ and DEI funding add up?","March 29, 2024",Grace Abels,"Federal Budget, LGBTQ, Pundits","The U.S. Senate passed a $1.2 trillion dollar spending package, narrowly avoiding a partial government shutdown. Before the bill was signed into law in the wee hours of March 23, one pundit criticized some of its details.

""What's in the new monster bill Congress is rushing to pass?"" Fox News host Jesse Watters posted March 21 on X, where it had 2.3 million views as of March 28. He wrote that the bill included: $850,000 for a ""gay senior home."" $15 million to pay for Egyptians’ college tuition. $400,000 for a ""gay activist group to teach elementary kids about being trans."" $500,000 for a ""DEI zoo."" $400,000 for ""a group to give clothes to teens to help them hide their gender."" His X post also included a clip of him discussing the earmarks on his show, ""Jesse Watters Primetime,"" the same night. He posted a similar claim on TikTok, where it amassed more than 500,000 views and 55,000 likes. We contacted Fox News, and a spokesperson shared a list of the funding items Watters was referring to. Joshua Sewell, research and policy director at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group, said the majority of federal spending is not distributed through earmarking. Sewell said the earmarks Watters noted ""don’t appear to be unique or out of character"" or ""excessively large"" when compared with other projects receiving earmarks. Except for the Egyptian college funding, all of the items Watters cited are from the budget’s Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education portion, which  Sewell said, has approximately 1,000 earmarks. Given the large number of earmarks, ""I’m sure everybody could find something they don’t think is a best use of funds,"" Sewell said.

E.J. Fagan, assistant professor of political science at the University of Illinois Chicago, agreed that earmarks ""are a teeny-tiny piece of the federal budget."" Fagan also said his ""impression from the backlash to these very small set of earmarks is that it is just cherry-picking."" His research on the FY 2022 budget found that 0.6% of all federal earmarks mentioned LGBTQ+ as a target population. Here, we examine each of Watters’ claims. This needs more context. The $850,000 earmark is for the Boston-based nonprofit LGBTQ Senior Housing Inc. to provide affordable housing for people 62 and older. It will help fund ""The Pryde,"" a 74-unit housing complex in Boston’s Hyde Park neighborhood that is slated to open this spring. But that complex  is not exclusive to gay people; it is open to anyone who meets the income and age requirements. The organization’s mission is to ""facilitate access to welcoming, safe and affordable housing for low-income LGBTQ+ seniors,"" by developing that housing and establishing onsite services and programming ""that addresses the needs of LGBTQ seniors."" The $850,000 will be used for programming and the complex’s community center, which also will be open to older people from the neighborhood who don’t live in the complex. The organization says the project is needed because of the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ seniors, some of whom may not have offspring to serve as caregivers or who may face discrimination or isolation. Applicants for the housing complex were not asked about their sexual orientation. ""It would be against the law to limit this affordable housing to just members of the LGBTQ+ community,"" said the organization’s executive director, Gretchen Van Ness. The money will come from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ funds for community living. Van Ness told PolitiFact that she applied for the funding through the office of Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., last year, because The Pryde is in Pressley’s district. This is missing context.

Fifteen million dollars is allocated to USAID, the federal agency that manages foreign aid, ""for scholarships for Egyptian students with high financial need to attend not-for-profit institutions of higher education in Egypt,"" that are accredited by agencies recognized by the United States Department of Education or meet equivalent standards, the budget description says. Similar Egyptian higher education funding has been provided to USAID over the past four decades, a USAID spokesperson told PolitiFact. The scholarships allow Egyptians to study at universities ""in fields critical to Egypt’s sustained economic growth and development."" Spending bills passed during Donald Trump’s presidency provided $10 million per year for the higher education scholarship program from 2017 through 2019 and increased it to $15 million in 2020. ""The State Department and USAID have a long history of funding numerous programs to support the spread of democracy and western values throughout the world,"" Taxpayers for Common Sense’s Sewell said. ""This is not a surprise."" This is misleading. Watters is referring to ""Garden State Equality,"" a New Jersey LGBTQ+ advocacy group and a state affiliate of the Equality Federation, a national network of LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations. The budget describes the $400,000 earmark as funding ""for trauma-informed strategies to support LGBTQ+ youth."" Garden State Equality Executive Director Christian Fuscarino told PolitiFact the funding will support programs to educate communities about adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, traumatic events early in life such as violence, abuse or neglect that can affect long-term health. Research has shown that LGBTQ+ people report higher rates of adverse childhood experiences.

Fuscarino said some of the federal funding will be used for a summer camp for high school-aged kids that teaches about the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion, and imparts some trauma-informed strategies. That can include sharing techniques such as breathing exercises to cope with trauma’s impacts, Fuscarino said. The money comes from the Department of Education’s funds for ""innovation and improvement.""

The organization also conducts professional development training with kindergarten through 12th grade educators on LGBTQ+ terminology and anti-bullying initiatives. It has developed LGBTQ+ lessons and curriculum resources. Since 2019, New Jersey law has required schools to teach LGBTQ+ history in middle and high schools, and adopt instructional materials that portray society’s diversity including the ""political, economic, and social contributions"" of LGBTQ+ people. A breakdown of how this funding will be spent is not yet finalized, Fuscarino told PolitiFact. Although the money is earmarked, the organization may not access the money until it submits a proposed budget and receives Department of Education approval.

Fuscarino said Watters’ characterization of the organization’s work as ""teaching"" elementary kids about ""being trans"" is inaccurate.

""We may go to a kindergarten class by being invited and read a story that is about an LGBTQ character,"" said Fuscarino, ""but that’s not the core of what we're doing."" Watters’ framing is misleading. (""DEI"" is an acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion.) The $500,000 earmark is for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, the nonprofit that manages the acclaimed San Diego Zoo. The money is for the nonprofit’s Nature Biodiversity Corps program that ""brings together inner-city high school students from diverse cultural, ethnic, and lived-experience perspectives,"" according to the website. The students ""design, implement, maintain, and monitor native wildlife gardens on their school campuses,"" alongside experts and Wildlife Alliance mentors, the website says.

The funding comes from the Department of Education’s funds for ""innovation and improvement."" In the clip from his show that Watters shared on X, Watters described the biodiversity program as ""an anti-racist nature appreciation program where high school kids from diverse backgrounds can observe wildlife."" But the program is more than a trip to the zoo.

Students spend 10 to 20 hours monthly working on wildlife gardens at their own schools and participating in nature-based learning experiences at wildlife conservation sites.

The website says that since 2022, 200 high school students have participated, creating 14 gardens. 

Race and ethnicity are not considerations for participation in the program, zoo spokesperson Jake Gonzales said. The earmark funding will go toward staff salaries, transportation and supplies — including native plants for the gardens — and toward reaching more students at more schools, Gonzales said. The zoo has received federal earmarks in previous years, but for other conservation projects. This claim is inaccurate. The funding is for Briarpatch Youth Services, a Madison, Wisconsin, nonprofit that runs a youth homeless shelter and works with at-risk youth.

The earmark was requested by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and would come from the Department of Health and Human Services’ funds for substance abuse and mental health services. Briarpatch’s website lists several programs including employment services, support for those navigating the criminal justice system and street outreach and counseling for homeless youth.

The nonprofit’s ""Teens Like Us"" program has a support group for ""queer and questioning youth"" beginning at age 13. In 2023, the Teens Like Us program included what organizers called the ""Briar-Attire Gender Affirming Clothing Program."" The program provided gender-affirming clothing such as chest binders and tucking underwear to those who could not afford or access them. The Teens Like Us website no longer lists the clothing program. Baldwin’s office told PolitiFact the $400,000 earmark can be used only for mental health services and counseling for kids experiencing homelessness, and will not be used for the Teens Like Us program. Briarpatch Executive Director Jill Pfeiffer confirmed that to PolitiFact."
"Baltimore bridge collapse: A cyberattack, a movie and other false claims about the ship accident","March 27, 2024",Jeff Cercone,"National, Infrastructure, Transportation","As investigators tried to determine why a container ship crashed into Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge, social media users shared baseless speculation about the cause. The collapse  left six people presumed dead and closed one of the nation’s busiest ports. Across social media platforms, people gave a variety of explanations for why the ship lost power and steered into the bridge. Here are some of the claims PolitiFact has debunked so far: It’s common after tragic national news for social media users with mixed motives to flock online and assert the event was intentional or staged to distract people from important issues. The Baltimore bridge collapse is no different. One social media user said the collapse was a false flag to divert attention from the raid of music mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs’ properties as part of a sex trafficking investigation. Online influencer Andrew Tate said that the ship was the target of a cyberattack that caused it to lose power and steer into the bridge. Both claims lack evidence. Maryland state and federal authorities said there’s no reason to believe the ship crashing into the bridge was intentional. An X post showed what appeared to be a Wikipedia page entry about the Baltimore bridge collapse that said, ""After the US abstained from the ceasefire resolution for Gaza, the Israelis deployed their Talmudic network to take down the bridge."" Anyone can edit a Wikipedia page, so even if that entry was real, it’s not proof that Israel directed an attack on the bridge. Chao, who drowned in February after accidentally backing her Tesla into a Texas pond, was the CEO of Foremost Group, her family’s shipping company. But her company didn’t own the Dali, the Singapore-based vessel that struck the Baltimore bridge. Grace Ocean Private Ltd. owns the Dali, and Synergy Marine Group manages the ship. Chao had no connection to either company. (Instagram screenshot) An Instagram video showed a real video of the Baltimore bridge collapsing but claimed that explosions brought it down. The video then purported to show the bridge from a different angle before a fiery explosion happened. The bridge explosion seen in the video came from 2022 footage on the Kerch bridge that connected Russia to Crimea. X, Instagram and TikTok users took U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s 2021 comments about racism in infrastructure design choices out of context, making it look as though he blamed the Baltimore bridge accident on racism to avoid accountability. Netflix trailer for Leave the World Behind. The 2023 Netflix movie ""Leave the World Behind,"" which lists former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as executive producers and is based on a 2021 novel, is about two families vacationing in Long Island, New York, who are trying to survive a mysterious cyberattack that caused a communication blackout. In one scene, a large cargo ship runs aground on a beach full of people, not into a bridge. Although there are visual similarities between the movie’s images and photos of the Baltimore scene, the movie’s story is fictional. In real life, authorities investigating the crash so far believe it was an accident. Social media claims that an unnamed Ukrainian national was the captain of the cargo ship that struck the Baltimore bridge are inaccurate. The Dali had a crew of 22 Indian nationals on board, said a spokesperson for the company that manages the ship.

"Joe Biden said he commuted by train and car as a senator, including over the Baltimore Key Bridge","March 27, 2024",Ciara O'Rourke,Facebook Fact-checks,"President Joe Biden came under criticism following his remarks about the collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge. ""#BREAKING,"" read a screenshot of an X post shared on Facebook on March 26. ""Joe Biden says he’s commuted over the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore many times via train. The problem is that the bridge features no train tracks."" Some news coverage also focused on Biden’s comments about taking trains. And former President Donald Trump’s campaign cited it as evidence that ""Biden (confused — again) claims to have gone over the Francis Scott Key Bridge by train ‘many times.’"" Before it collapsed, the four-lane bridge spanned 1.6 miles — and, no, the bridge does not have train tracks. But these social media posts did not present Biden’s full statement that allowed for some ambiguity; he mentioned commuting by car. Here’s what he said March 26 at the White House:  ""At about 1:30, a container ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which I’ve been over many, many times commuting from the state of Delaware either on a train or by car."" The White House clarified Biden’s comments to the New York Post, which ran a story headlined: ""Biden claims he commuted over collapsed Baltimore Key Bridge by train’ many times’ —  but it doesn’t have any rail lines."" ""The President is clearly describing driving over the bridge while commuting between Delaware and (Washington) D.C. during his 36-year Senate career,"" the New York Post quoted White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson saying in a statement. Biden has a long history of commuting to the capital. On the White House website, a section recounting the president’s history says that after he was sworn into the U.S. Senate, he ""began commuting from Wilmington to Washington every day, first by car, and then by train, in order to be with his family. He would continue to do so throughout his time in the Senate."" In 2023, The Associated Press called him ""arguably the nation’s biggest Amtrak fan."" PBS NewsHour said in 2021 that, as a senator, Biden ""was a fixture on Amtrak trains between his home in Wilmington, Delaware, and Washington, D.C., when the Senate was in session. He continued riding Amtrak as vice president. He has sometimes been referred to as ‘Amtrak Joe.’"""
"At stake in mifepristone case: abortion, FDA’s authority and return to 1873 obscenity law","March 25, 2024",Sarah Varney,"Abortion, Supreme Court","Lawyers from the conservative Christian group that won the case to overturn Roe v. Wade are returning to the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday in pursuit of an urgent priority: shutting down access to abortion pills for women across the country. The case challenges the FDA’s regulation of mifepristone, a prescription-only drug approved in 2000 with a stellar safety record that is used in 63% of all U.S. abortions. Viewed across decades of anti-abortion activism, the case brought by the Alliance Defending Freedom represents a ""moonshot"" couched in technical arguments about pharmaceutical oversight and the resuscitation of an 1873 anti-obscenity law. A victory would lay the groundwork for a de facto nationwide abortion ban. Abortion is illegal in 14 states, but abortion pills have never been more widely available. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA suspended — and later formally lifted — the requirement that patients be at a health care facility when taking mifepristone, the first of two pills used in medication abortion. Physicians can now prescribe the drug online through telemedicine and pharmacies can dispense it through the mail. ""You don’t need to be handed the pill in the office,"" said Linda Prine, a family medicine physician, sitting on a couch in her Manhattan apartment answering texts and calls from patients about abortion care. ""It’s very effective,"" she said. ""I don’t even have medications that are 98 to 99% effective. Our blood pressure medicines aren’t effective like that."" Prine, a co-founder of the Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline, works with other doctors operating under New York state’s shield law to prescribe and send abortion pills to people across the country. A review of Prine’s call log, stripped of personal information, showed hundreds of requests for pills from Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee, and other states where it is illegal for women to stop a pregnancy. Anti-abortion groups unsuccessfully petitioned the FDA at least twice before, in 2002 and 2019, to revoke mifepristone’s approval and curtail its availability. But in November 2022, following its victory in overturning federal abortion rights, the Alliance Defending Freedom filed a federal lawsuit in Amarillo, Texas, claiming the FDA’s safety review of mifepristone was flawed. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who was appointed by President Donald Trump and openly opposes abortion, ruled to invalidate the FDA’s approval of mifepristone. An appeals court later said the drug should remain available, but it reinstated restrictions, including prohibitions on telehealth prescriptions and mailing the medication. That ruling was put on hold while the Supreme Court considers the case. The Biden administration and a manufacturer of mifepristone, Danco Laboratories, have argued in legal filings to the Supreme Court that federal judges do not have the scientific and health expertise to evaluate drug safety and that allowing them to do so undermines the FDA’s regulatory authority. That view is supported by food and drug legal scholars who wrote in court filings that the lower courts had replaced the ""FDA’s scientific and medical expertise with the courts’ own interpretations of the scientific evidence."" In doing so, they wrote, the courts ""upend the drug regulatory scheme established by Congress and implemented by FDA."" In his ruling, Kacsmaryk cited two studies purporting to show an increase in emergency room visits and a greater risk of hospitalizations from medication abortion. They were retracted in February by medical publisher Sage Perspectives. The journal said the researchers erred in their methodology and analysis of the data and invalidated the papers ""in whole or in part."" The research, supported by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion group that filed a brief in the mifepristone case, ""made claims that were not supported by the data,"" said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor of reproductive sciences at the University of California-San Francisco. Legal scholars say the Supreme Court’s conservative justices have demonstrated a willingness to accept discredited abortion-related health claims. Justice Samuel Alito, writing the majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned the constitutional right to abortion, cited statements about harm to maternal health presented by the state of Mississippi that contradict mainstream medical consensus. ""If this case is successful, it will be because the Supreme Court decided to ignore evidence that demonstrated mifepristone’s safety and said to a federal agency, the expert on drug safety, ‘You were wrong,’"" said Rachel Rebouché, dean of Temple University Beasley School of Law. The mifepristone case crystallizes ""the politicization of science"" in abortion regulation, Rebouché said. ""But the stakes are getting higher as we have courts willing to strip federal agencies of their ability to make expert decisions."" Rebouché said that if the Supreme Court overrides the FDA’s expertise in regulating a 24-year-old drug like mifepristone, anti-abortion groups, like Students for Life of America, could find judges receptive to false claims that birth control pills, intrauterine devices, emergency contraception, and other forms of hormonal birth control cause abortion. They do not, according to reproductive scientists and U.S. and international regulatory agencies. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion in Dobbs that the Supreme Court should reconsider the 1965 decision that guaranteed a constitutional right to contraception, Griswold v. Connecticut, and decide whether to return the power to allow or regulate access to birth control to the states. Tucked into the Alliance Defending Freedom’s filings is what scholars describe as an audacious legal strategy once on the fringes of the conservative Christian movement: an appeal to the Supreme Court’s conservative members to determine that the Comstock Act, a dormant 1873 anti-vice law, effectively bans medical and procedural abortion nationwide. Passed at a time when the federal government did not give women the right to vote and the prevailing medical literature summed up women’s sexuality by saying that ""the majority of women (happily for them) are not very much troubled with sexual feelings of any kind,"" the long unenforced law carried a five-year prison sentence for anyone mailing ""every article, instrument, substance, drug, medicine or thing which is advertised or described in a manner calculated to lead another to use or apply it for producing abortion."" References to the Comstock Act appear throughout anti-abortion legal filings and rulings: Kacsmaryk wrote that the act ""plainly forecloses mail-order abortion in the present""; the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote if Comstock was ""strictly understood"" then ""there is no public interest in the perpetuation of illegality""; Republican attorneys general threatened legal action against Walgreens and CVS last year citing Comstock as did anti-abortion cases in New Mexico and Texas. ""State attorneys general need to go after and prosecute those who are illegally mailing abortion drugs into their state,"" said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America. ""It’s very simple. If your state has passed a law saying that preborn human beings deserve, at the very minimum, the right not to be starved and killed,"" she said, ""then those who are committing those crimes and violating the federal Comstock Act by shipping chemical abortion pills over state lines, there should be consequences."" Tracking abortion pills by mail is difficult — and that’s the point, Rebouché said. ""These more diffuse and mobile ways to terminate a pregnancy,"" she said, ""really threaten the control that anti-abortion advocates seek to exercise over who and where and how someone can seek an abortion.""

More immigrants equal better odds for Democrats after the next census? Why those claims are flawed,"March 25, 2024",Jeff Cercone,"Immigration, National, Congress, Elections","High-profile people, Republican politicians and social media users are portraying increased immigration at the U.S. southern border as a Democratic plot to increase political power. The claims hinge on the U.S. Census, which determines congressional seats and electoral votes, and counts everyone, citizens and noncitizens, including immigrants in the country illegally. The census has always counted this way; the U.S. Constitution specifies ""counting the whole number of persons in each state."" ""Most Americans are still unaware that the census counts ALL people, including illegal immigrants, for deciding how many House seats each state gets!"" Elon Musk wrote March 7 on X, his social media platform. ""This results in Dem states getting roughly 20 more House seats, which is another strong incentive for them not to deport illegals."" Congressional Republicans have introduced legislation that would bar the census from counting noncitizens, including those in the U.S. legally, such as green card holders. Former President Donald Trump tried, and failed, to do that. ""Democrats are exploiting the rights of U.S. citizens by encouraging illegal immigrants to enter the U.S., travel to sanctuary cities, and skew congressional redistricting for political gain,"" said Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, one of the legislation sponsors, in a January news release. Stephen Miller, who led the Trump administration’s immigration policy, said in March, ""California would have half of the Electoral College votes it has right now but for illegal immigration."" Social media users amplified the claims. The speaker in a March 9 Instagram video said, ""This is not an accident,"" pointing to a headline about a sharp rise in migration. The post’s caption noted that the census counts everybody and said, ""The census counts ALL people — including illegal immigrants — when deciding how many House seats each state gets. Biden signed an executive order ensuring things stayed that way. This invasion is by design."" The rhetoric echoes the ""great replacement theory,"" a baseless conspiracy theory that warns Democrats and world leaders are systematically trying to replace white people of European descent with nonwhite people. We found no evidence that counting immigrants in the country illegally would give Democrats a significant advantage for congressional seats. Two reports published before the 2020 Census projected that not counting them would basically have been a wash, with Democratic-led states and Republican-led states gaining and losing similar numbers of U.S. House seats. More recent studies showed that immigrant populations, both here legally and illegally, have increased significantly in Republican-led states in recent years. Here’s what we know about how immigrants in the country illegally affect political power in Congress. Musk cited no source for his claim that illegal immigration gives Democrats 20 more House seats. Other social media posts and conservative media articles said that immigrants in the U.S. illegally account for about 22 U.S. House seats. The latter estimates are based on data from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for reduced immigration. The federation says there are about 16.8 million immigrants in the country illegally as of June 2023. People making the 22 U.S. House seats claim divided the 16.8 million by 761,169, the number of people each congressional seat represents. However, other immigration groups estimate a lower population of immigrants in the country illegally, ranging from 10.5 million to 11.35 million. Each state is guaranteed one of the 435 House seats in the U.S. Congress, and the remaining 385 seats are divided among the 50 states based on the census count. The current formula used for apportionment, called the Method of Equal Proportions, has been used since 1941. It’s based on a state’s population and aims to minimize the difference in representation among states. The next census, in 2030, will be used to appropriate federal funding for public resources such as schools and roads and programs including Medicaid, determine 2033 congressional apportionment and allocate electoral votes for the presidency. Each state gets two electoral votes — equal to its number of senators — plus one vote for each of its representatives in Congress. The U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment says the apportionment of representatives should be determined by counting the ""whole number of persons in each state."" The language does not make exceptions for people’s immigration status. Most groups estimate the number from 10 million to 11 million people. The Federation for American Immigration Reform’s estimate of 16.8 million is higher because the group’s methodology accounts for what it says is a 30% undercount of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. The Center for Migration Studies, Pew, the Center for Immigration Studies and the Migration Policy Institute all factored in census undercounts when determining their most recent figures. The undercounts exist because numbers shift; migrants in the country illegally also leave, die or gain legal status. The largest, most densely populated states, both Democratic- and Republican-led, have the highest number of immigrants in the country illegally. The top six states have remained fairly consistent since at least 1990, Pew Research Center 2021 data shows: California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. In 1990, those states were home to 80% of immigrants in the country illegally; in 2021, it was 56%. ""Immigrant populations are growing in other places where you have economic opportunity,"" said Yurij Rudensky, senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. ""There are immigrant populations in places like South Carolina and Tennessee and places where you see growth in manufacturing or other sorts of industry."" The Center for Migration Studies said in a January report that after a decade of decline, the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. jumped by 650,000 in 2022. Florida had the largest increase with 125,000. Texas was next with 60,000, followed by New York (50,000), Maryland (45,000) and California (40,000). A billboard in Dearborn, Michigan, encourages residents to take part in the 2020 census. The count determines congressional apportionment and federal funding for states and communities. (AP) Studies from before and after the 2020 census don’t support the claim. Two reports projecting what would happen if immigrants in the country illegally weren’t counted toward congressional apportionment in the 2020 Census show that neither Democrats nor Republicans would have gained a significant advantage: A 2019 Center for Immigration Studies report showed three states would have lost one U.S House seat: Democratic-led California and New York, and Republican-led Texas. Three others would have gained a seat: Republican-led Alabama and Ohio, and Democratic-led Minnesota. A 2020 Pew Research Center study reached a similar conclusion. California, Texas and Republican-led Florida would lose a seat, while Alabama, Ohio and Minnesota would have each gained one seat. However, the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said in a January 2024 report that the vast majority of the increase in noncitizen populations, both legal immigrants and immigrants in the country illegally, has gone to Republican-led states. The report found that 95% of the increase in noncitizen populations from March 2019 to March 2023 has been in Republican-led states. Republican-led states gained 1,275,598 people, while Democratic-led states gained 71,973 people. ""The argument that recent immigration is boosting Democratic representation in Congress is unsubstantiated,"" wrote David Bier, the report’s author. Experts we contacted provided mixed responses. Steven Camarota, research director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports limited immigration, disputed that idea. ""It is hard to argue that immigration does not on balance help Democrats,"" Camarota said. He said immigrants and their children, once they obtain citizenship and the legal right to vote, typically have voted for Democrats, citing 2020 exit polls and a Pew analysis. Camarota said the Census Bureau’s monthly Current Population Survey during the three years of Biden’s presidency shows the population of all immigrants growing the most in states that tend to be blue: California, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia. That includes both legal immigrants and those in the country illegally. Camarota pointed to a 2020 Center for Immigration Studies report  that showed congressional districts with a higher percentage of noncitizens means that voters in those districts ""have significantly more political power,"" because it takes fewer votes to win in a district with high numbers of noncitizens. The low-citizen-count districts are almost all represented by Democrats, he said. Robert Warren, a Center for Migration Studies researcher, said he conducted a simulation using 2016 data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey and the Center for Migration Studies, and found that if immigrants in the country illegally were included in a census count, California would gain two U.S. House seats, and New York and Texas would each gain one seat. Michigan, Minnesota, Montana and Pennsylvania would each lose a seat. ""I don’t see an advantage for either party based on these results,"" Warren said. Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, a Penn State University sociology and demography professor, is skeptical of the claim that Democrats have 20 or more U.S. House seats because of illegal immigration. By her calculations, immigrants in the country illegally are represented by about 14 House seats distributed across both red and blue states, with Republicans holding a slight advantage, eight seats versus the Democrats’ six. She said she didn’t look at the distribution of the immigrant population within each state. Brian Gaines, a University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign political science professor, said Democrats likely would get a boost if the population of  immigrants in the country illegally continues to rise before the next census. But he said the apportionment method doesn’t ""systematically favor large or small states"" and partisan redistricting in states is a factor, so it can be hard to forecast, he said. The last time the Census asked all households about citizenship was in 1950. From 1970 to 2000, about 1 in 6 households received a long-form census questionnaire that included a question on citizenship. The 2010 Census used only a 10-question short-form questionnaire that did not ask about citizenship. Trump tried and failed in 2019 to require a citizenship question on the 2020 Census; his effort was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump later issued executive orders seeking to compel the Census Bureau to obtain information about immigration status through other means, and to exclude immigrants in the country illegally from being counted for apportionment. The Census Bureau abandoned efforts to provide a count of people here illegally to Trump near the end of his presidency. President Joe Biden, on his first day in office, signed an executive order reversing Trump’s executive orders. U.S. Senate Republicans on March 8 failed to pass an amendment by Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., to a spending package that would have required a citizenship question on the census and barred noncitizens, including immigrants in the country illegally, from being counted for congressional district and Electoral College apportionment, Fox News reported. Hagerty also introduced a bill, the Equal Representation Act, in January that seeks the same outcome. It has been referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., introduced a House version of the bill in January. Those bills, if passed, would exclude both immigrants in the country illegally and the estimated 12.7 million lawful permanent residents in the U.S from being counted. Removing noncitizens from the Census Count would likely require a constitutional amendment, the Congressional Research Service wrote in 2015. Rudensky, of the Brennan Center for Justice, said these efforts ""cut against both the text of the Constitution and now centuries of practice. ""Both citizens and noncitizens alike pay taxes, send kids to school, use roads, and while who votes is contingent on citizenship, everyone who is part of our community, everyone who is living and working within the U.S. gets represented."""
In context: Judging Milwaukee’s crime rate,"March 22, 2024",Elliot Hughes,"Crime, Wisconsin","Crime is always a big issue during election season, and in Wisconsin, there are already hints at how the topic might be discussed as things heat up toward November. Even though the state’s governorship isn’t on the ballot this year, the Republican Party of Wisconsin recently took a shot at Gov. Tony Evers regarding Milwaukee’s crime numbers. In a January post on X (formerly known as Twitter), the state GOP’s account said Evers’ 2023 record included ""Milwaukee suffering from the third-highest violent crime rate in America."" It listed two other items and concluded that ""Wisconsin deserves better in 2024."" About a month later, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, whose office is on the April ballot, made his own assertion in an X post: ""Because of our partnership with police and the community, in Milwaukee we saw double digit decreases in homicide, vehicle theft, and property crime from 2022 to 2023."" There are plenty of misunderstandings about crime and how it’s measured in the U.S. Are the two statements accurate? Do they even represent a fair way of judging crime trends in a city? Time for a closer look. Matt Fisher, the state GOP’s spokesperson, said the source behind the party’s post was a story by Spectrum News 1. That story cited a May 2023 report from SafeHome.org about cities with the highest crime rates. For one, that SafeHome.org report is based on FBI data from 2021, not 2023. It wasn’t until March 2024 that the FBI made preliminary data available for nationwide crime trends in 2023, and nothing firmer than that is expected until the fall. But even the FBI warns against ranking and comparing cities based on its data ""because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place."" The agency lists more than a dozen, including population density, urbanization, economic conditions, transportation, cultural factors, climate and strength of law enforcement. There’s one other factor the FBI cites that’s particularly important, and particularly important as it relates to 2021 crime data — how crime is reported. There are two components to consider. One is that the majority of violent and property crimes aren’t reported to law enforcement. The federal government conducts a National Crime Victimization Survey, which measures how much crimes are underreported. Surveys each year from 2019 through 2022 suggest that only four out of 10 violent victimizations are reported to police. One in three property victimizations are reported. The second component deals with how well the FBI collected crime data in 2021. The crime data the FBI collected for 2021 is flawed and ""particularly useless,"" said Jeff Asher, a crime data analyst who runs AH Datalytics, a data analysis research firm. That year, the FBI switched to a system of collecting data from law enforcement agencies across the country. The goal is to produce more nuanced crime data. Asher said the switch was a mess in its first year. When normally around 95% of agencies would report crime data to the FBI, in 2021, a little more than half reported, he said. For example, Asher said, of the cities with a population of 500,000 to 1 million — which would include Milwaukee — only 24 of them reported data in 2021, compared with 35 in 2022. Asher said SafeHome.org’s conclusion about Milwaukee’s violent crime is accurate based on its methodology and the data it had. But he also said it was ""like saying the Saints are the best professional football team in Louisiana. If you’ve got a very narrow definition of your problem, then you can use the data to work however you want. ""I certainly would advise against using rankings from websites that are using old data that aren’t acknowledging severe problems with the underlying data."" In general, Asher said it’s better to judge a city’s crime numbers by measuring how they’ve changed over time. That’s what Johnson did in his post, although he only compared two years of data. But his claim is correct, according to the Milwaukee Police Department. The city had double-digit percentage drops in homicides (20%), car theft (23%) and property crime (13%) from 2022 to 2023. Of course, the further back you look, the more perspective you get. In 2020, the U.S. had a historic 29% increase in homicides, while violent crime in general rose 5.6%, according to the FBI. Those trends are often attributed to the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic and the murder of George Floyd. Car theft has also skyrocketed nationally in recent years. The country has slowly been recovering since. But homicides, aggravated assaults and car theft remain high in cities across the nation compared with 2019, according to the Council on Criminal Justice. That’s true in Milwaukee, too. According to police data, homicides (74%), aggravated assaults (20%) and car theft (79%) were still up in 2023 compared to 2019, despite big drops compared with 2022."
What is ‘sex’? What is ‘gender’? How these terms changed and why states now want to define them,"March 22, 2024",Grace Abels,"National, LGBTQ","After decades of creating laws that assumed ""sex"" and ""gender"" were synonymous, lawmakers across the country are taking another look at how states define those terms. Scientific and legal interpretations of these words have evolved considerably in the past century. Today, medical experts understand biological sex assigned at birth as more complex and consider it distinct from gender identity. In 2020, the Supreme Court also broadened its understanding of sex discrimination in employment to include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

Grappling with this cultural, scientific, and legal shift in the meaning of ""sex"" and ""gender,"" lawmakers in some states have tried defining the terms narrowly in state law as biological and binary. In 2023, four states passed such laws and, this year, 17 states introduced bills defining ""sex."" Some bills in Florida and West Virginia were defeated, but 15 bills are still advancing in states across the country.



This focus on terminology may seem rhetorical, but these legislative changes can restrict access to driver’s licenses and documents that match a person’s gender identity. Transgender rights advocates say that requiring IDs to match the sex a person was assigned at birth can expose transgender Americans to discrimination.

So, how do we understand these terms, and what could these definitions mean for everyday life once codified? Until the mid-20th century, Americans' understanding of ""sex"" was largely biological and binary.

""For a substantial time period, law in the United States defined identity categories, such as race and sex, in biological terms,"" said Darren Hutchinson, an law professor at Emory University law professor. In the 1950s and ’60s, psychological research emerged that differentiated biological sex from ""gender."" Researchers coined terms such as ""gender roles"" as they studied people born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that didn’t fit the typical definitions of male or female and observed how children sometimes developed identity distinct from their biological sex.

By the early 1960s, the term ""gender identity"" began appearing in academic literature. By 1980, ""gender identity disorder of childhood"" was included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders’ third edition. This inclusion signaled that the concept of gender identity ""was part of the accepted nomenclature being used,"" said Dr. Jack Drescher, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University. Before the 1970s, the word ""gender"" was rarely used in American English, according to research by Stefan Th. Gries, a linguistics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He said evidence suggests it was used mostly when discussing grammar to describe the ""gender"" of a noun in Spanish, for example. Edward Schiappa, a professor of communication and rhetoric at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, observed in his book ""The Transgender Exigency"" that the rising use of ""gender"" in English coincided with the term’s introduction into psychological literature and its adoption by the feminist movement. Feminists saw the term as useful for describing the cultural aspects of being a ""woman"" as different from the biological aspects, he said. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who argued sex discrimination cases before the court in the 1970s, said that she intentionally used the term ""gender discrimination"" because it lacked the salacious overtones ""sex"" has.

After the 1980s, gender’s term usage rose rapidly, moving beyond academic and activist circles. In common American English, ""sex"" and ""gender"" began to be used more interchangeably, including in state law — sometimes even in the same section of the law.

In Florida’s chapter on driver’s licenses, for example, the section on new license applications uses ""gender,"" but the section on replacement licenses uses ""sex."" Today, medical experts and most major medical organizations agree that sex and gender are different. Sex is a biological category determined by physical features such as genes, hormones and genitalia. People are male, female or sometimes have reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t fit the typical definitions of male or female, often called intersex. Gender is different, experts say. Gender identity refers to someone’s internal sense of being a man, woman, or a nonbinary gender. For cisgender people, their sex and gender are the same, while transgender people may experience a mismatch between the two — their gender may not correspond to the sex they were assigned at birth. Our legal understanding of ""sex discrimination"" has also evolved. In 2020, the Supreme Court decided Bostock v. Clayton County, a series of cases in which employers were accused of firing employees for being gay or transgender. The court held that this was a form of ""sex discrimination"" prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Whether the court will extend this interpretation to other areas of federal law is unclear, legal experts told us. Recently, lawmakers have tried to codify their understandings of ""sex"" and ""gender"" into law.

In some cases, these laws aim to recognize and protect transgender Americans. The Democratic-backed Equality Act, which passed the House, but not the Senate, in 2019 and 2021, would have federally protected against discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation and gender identity. Some states have passed similar equality legislation, creating a patchwork of anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people.

But lawmakers in many Republican-led states have proposed narrow definitions of sex and gender that would apply to large sections of state law. ""Women and men are not identical; they possess unique biological differences,"" Iowa’s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds said in a press release detailing her support for the state’s version of such a bill. She added, ""This bill protects women’s spaces and rights afforded to us by Iowa law and the Constitution.""


Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds speaks July 28, 2023, at the Republican Party of Iowa's 2023 Lincoln Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP) Opponents reject the idea that the bills relate to women’s rights and claim the bills are an attempt to ""erase"" legal recognition of transgender people.

In 2023, four states passed laws defining sex, and two other states did so via executive order.

The Kansas Legislature, for example, passed the ""Women’s Bill of Rights"" overriding Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto. The law says that ""pursuant to any state law or rules and regulations … An individual's ‘sex’ means such individual's biological sex, either male or female, at birth."" The law defines male and female as based on whether a person’s reproductive system ""is developed to produce ova,"" or ""is developed to fertilize the ova of a female."" Because of the bill, transgender Kansans may no longer amend the sex listed on their birth certificates or update their driver's licenses to be different from their sex assigned at birth, although courts are reviewing this policy. The Kansas law also states that ""distinctions between the sexes with respect to athletics, prisons or other detention facilities, domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, locker rooms, restrooms and other areas where biology, safety or privacy are implicated"" are related to ""important governmental objectives"" a condition required under the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment. Rose Saxe, lawyer and deputy project director of the LGBTQ and HIV project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Kansas law does not explicitly require those spaces to be segregated by ""sex"" as the bill defines, but tries to justify policies that would do so. This year, 17 more states considered bills that would narrowly define ""sex"" and/or ""gender"" in state law according to the ACLU’s anti-LGBTQ legislation tracker. One, Utah, signed a definition into law, and 10 other states are advancing 15 bills combined. In the remaining six states, the bills were carried over to next year or defeated. The Utah State Capitol is viewed March 1, 2024, in Salt Lake City. (AP)

Some bills, such as Arizona’s S.B. 1628 change the terms for the entire statute: ""This state shall replace the stand-alone term ‘gender’ with ‘sex’ in all laws, rules, publications, orders, actions, programs, policies, and signage,"" it reads. The state Senate passed the bill 16-13 on Feb. 22, along party lines with Republicans in favor. Other bills, such as Idaho’s H.B. 421, don’t replace the word ""gender"" but declare it synonymous to ""sex.""  Gender, when used in state law, ""shall be considered a synonym for ‘sex’ and shall not be considered a synonym for gender identity, an internal sense of gender, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role,"" reads the text of the bill, which passed the Idaho House 54-14 on Feb. 7. Saxe said the bills could have a cascading effect on other laws.

Two bills in Florida, neither of which passed, would have explicitly required driver’s licenses to reflect sex assigned at birth. Advocates, including Saxe, worry that other sex-defining bills would have a similar consequence.

Transgender rights advocates say access to identification that matches an individual’s identity and presentation is important. ""If you can’t update the gender marker on your ID, you are essentially outed as transgender at every turn,"" said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality to PolitiFact for a previous story on drivers licenses in Florida. This can happen during interactions with potential landlords, employers, cashiers, bartenders and restaurant servers. Kentucky and Georgia are following Kansas’s lead and considering their own ""Women’s Bill of Rights"" based on model legislation created by the conservative advocacy group, Independent Women’s Voice, and the Women’s Liberation Front, a feminist group opposing what it terms ""gender ideology.""

There are variations. The bill in Georgia, for example, would remove ""gender identity"" and ""sexual orientation"" from the state's definition of a hate crime. ""Even in the states that have passed these bills,"" said Paisley Currah, a political science professor at the City University of New York, ""there's still going to be these contradictions,"" because a person’s driver's license might not match the gender on their passport, for example. ""Unless you're a prisoner or immigrant or you are in the Army, the government actually doesn't get to look at your body,"" said Currah, who wrote a book on how government agencies address ""sex"" categories. ""It's always some doctor that signs a letter … and so there's always a document between your body and the state."" How these sex-defining laws would affect state agencies remains to be seen. And the laws may face court challenges, likely on the grounds that they violate the Equal Protection Clause or right to privacy, Saxe said."
AI-generated audio deepfakes are increasing. We tested 4 tools designed to detect them.,"March 20, 2024",Loreben Tuquero,Technology,"It took a New Orleans street magician only 20 minutes and $1 to create audio that sounded like President Joe Biden discouraging Democrats from voting in the New Hampshire primary. The robocall was found to be a product of artificial intelligence, and soon after, the Federal Communications Commission banned AI-generated voices in robocalls. But identifying AI-generated audio in the wild is easier said than done. We tested four free online tools that claim to determine whether an audio clip is AI-generated. Only one of them signaled that the Biden-like robocall was likely AI-generated. Experts told us that AI audio detection tools are lacking in accuracy and shouldn’t be trusted on their own. Nevertheless, people can employ other techniques to spot potential misinformation. ""Audio deepfakes may be more challenging to detect than image or video deepfakes,"" said Manjeet Rege, director of the Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence at the University of St. Thomas. ""Audio lacks the full context and visual cues of video, so believable audio alone is easier to synthesize convincingly."" Many people have called a business or government agency and heard an automatic response from a synthetic voice. But only recently did people start using the technology to create deepfakes, said Siwei Lyu, a computer science and engineering professor at the University at Buffalo. Lyu said audio deepfakes typically fall under two types: text-to-speech and voice conversion. The biggest difference between the two, he said, is the input. Text-to-speech systems enable computers to convert text into what sounds like a spoken voice. Voice conversion, by contrast, will take a person’s voice and manipulate it so that it sounds like another person’s voice, retaining the emotion and inhalation patterns of the original speech. Creating deepfake audio is an attractive alternative to creating deepfake video because audio is easier and cheaper to produce. For example, online startup ElevenLabs, offers a free plan to people seeking to convert text to speech. The startup has gained prominence in the industry and was recently valued at $1.1 billion after raising $80 million in venture capital funding. Its paid plans start at $1 per month and its products also include voice cloning, which allows users to create synthetic copies of their own voices, and a tool that can help people classify whether something is AI-generated. ""The rise of audio deepfakes opens up disturbing possibilities for spreading misinformation,"" Rege said. Aside from making it possible for machines to impersonate public figures, politicians and celebrities, falsified audio could also be used to trick security systems that make use of voice authentication, he said. For example, a Vice reporter in February 2023 demonstrated how he was able to trick his bank’s authentication system by calling its service line and playing clips of his AI-powered cloned voice. Rege warned that fake audio could have implications for court cases, intelligence operations and politics. Some potential scenarios: Using fake audio recordings to prompt authorities to pursue false intelligence targets. Submitting fake audio recordings of defendants confessing to crimes or making incriminating statements Impersonating public officials’ voices to spread disinformation or obtain sensitive information Rege and Lyu said synthetic audio is created using ""deep learning"" technology that trains AI models to learn characteristics of speech based on a large dataset of diverse speakers, voices and conversations. With this information, the technology can recreate speech. PolitiFact identified TikTok and YouTube accounts that uploaded videos that perpetuated false narratives about the 2024 election using audio that expert analysis showed was generated by AI. Because audio is one-dimensional and more ephemeral than images and videos, Lyu said, it’s harder to determine when it’s not real; this makes it more effective at misleading people. It’s harder to review a piece of audio to check for signs of AI generation. You can pause a video or inspect an image you encounter online. But if you pick up a call, you might not realize you’re listening to AI-generated audio or get to record it. Without a digital copy, it would be hard to analyze the audio. With audio deepfake technology evolving quickly, the tools designed to detect them are struggling to keep up. ""Detecting audio deepfakes is an active research area, meaning that it is currently treated as an unsolved problem,"" said Jennifer Williams, a lecturer at the University of Southampton who specializes in audio AI safety. Many online tools that claim to detect AI generated voices are available only with a paid subscription or upon demo request. Others ask customers to send the audio file to an email address. We looked for free options. V.S. Subrahmanian, a Northwestern University computer science professor, launched his own AI audio detection experiment at the Northwestern Security & AI Lab, which he leads. The group tested 14 off-the-shelf or free, publicly available audio deepfake detection tools, he said. The research is not yet publicly available, but he said the results were discouraging. ""You cannot rely on audio deepfake detectors today and I cannot recommend one for use,"" Subrahmanian said. We persevered, anyway, and found three free tools: ElevenLabs’ Speech Classifier, AI or Not and PlayHT. We also tested the DeepFake-O-Meter, which was developed by the University at Buffalo Media Forensic Lab, which  Lyu heads. For our experiment, we obtained a copy of the fake Biden robocall from the New Hampshire attorney general’s office and ran it through the four tools. In the robocall that circulated before the Jan. 23 New Hampshire primary, a Biden-like voice told Democratic voters that voting in the primary ""only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again."" It encouraged people not to vote until November. Soon after, security software company Pindrop said it found a 99% likelihood that the audio was created using ElevenLabs — a finding that magician Paul Carpenter later confirmed, telling NBC News that it took him less than 20 minutes and $1 to make. ElevenLabs has its own AI speech classifier — released in 2023, before the robocall circulated —  that measures the likelihood of an audio clip being created using its system. We uploaded the audio clip we obtained from the New Hampshire attorney general’s office to ElevenLabs’ speech classifier. The result? It found a 2% probability — ""very unlikely"" — that the audio was created with ElevenLabs. (Screenshot of ElevenLabs page) It’s unclear why ElevenLabs returned such a low result. Pindrop also experimented using ElevenLabs’ tool and said it returned an 84% probability score that the audio was created using ElevenLabs. Lyu said audio file compression and other factors can destroy signatures or features that detectors use to detect AI generation. And we do not know whether Pindrop used the same audio file. (Pindrop has its own audio deepfake detection system, available upon demo request.) We did the same test using AI or Not, a tool American tech company Optic developed. The result said the audio clip was ""likely human."" Anatoly Kvitnitsky, AI or Not’s chief executive, told Politifact that the audio sample ""had a lot of noise associated with it,"" making its AI origins less able to be detected without linguistic experts. ""AI was only confirmed when the creator of the recording admitted to it being AI,"" Kvitnitsky said. (Screenshot of AI or Not page) We also tested the audio using PlayHT, but it displayed an error message every time we upload the fake Biden audio. (Screenshot of  PlayHT page) We contacted ElevenLabs and PlayHT for comment but did not hear back. Lyu said deepfake audio detection has fewer available services than images and videos. He said this is partly because deepfake images and videos were developed earlier. Rege said although researchers have also developed open-source tools, the tools’ accuracy remains to be seen. ""I would say no single tool is considered fully reliable yet for the general public to detect deepfake audio,"" Rege said. ""A combined approach using multiple detection methods is what I will advise at this stage."" The University at Buffalo Media Forensic Lab’s DeepFake-O-Meter has not officially launched, Lyu said, but people need only create an account to use it for free. The DeepFake-O-Meter returned a 69.7% likelihood score of the Biden audio being AI-generated — the most accurate result among the tools we’ve tested. (Screenshot of DeepFake-O-Meter page) Subrahmanian said audio calls requesting money, personal information, passwords, bank codes or two factor authentication codes ""should be treated with extreme caution"" and warned people never to give such information over the phone. ""Urgency is a key giveaway,"" he said, ""Scammers want you (to) do things immediately, before you have time to consult others or think more deeply about a request. Don't fall for it."" Lyu and Rege said people should watch for signs of AI-generated audio, including irregular or absent breathing noises, intentional pauses and intonations, along with inconsistent room acoustics. They also said users should seek to verify the audio’s sources and cross-check the facts. ""Be skeptical of unsolicited audio messages or recordings, especially those claiming to be from authority figures, celebrities, or people you know,"" Rege said. Use common sense approaches and ask questions like who or where the call came from and whether it is supported by independent and unrelated sources, Lyu said. In an interview with Scientific American, Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley, computer science professor, also stressed provenance — or basic, trustworthy facts about a piece’s origins — when analyzing audio recordings: ""Where was it recorded? When was it recorded? Who recorded it? Who leaked it to the site that originally posted it?"" When it comes to legal matters, financial transactions, or important events, Rege said, people can protect themselves by insisting on verifying identities through other secure channels beyond audio or voice. ""Healthy skepticism is warranted given how realistic this emerging technology has become,"" Rege said."
"How political ambitions could support, or sink, pushes to protect abortion rights","March 20, 2024",Rachana Pradhan,"Abortion, National","ST. LOUIS — In early February, abortion rights supporters gathered to change Missouri history at the Pageant — a storied club where rock ’n’ roll revolutionary Chuck Berry often had played: They launched a signature-gathering campaign to put a constitutional amendment to voters this year to legalize abortion in the state ""We have fought long for this moment,"" the Rev. Love Holt, the master of ceremonies, told the crowd. ""Just two years after Missouri made abortion illegal in virtually all circumstances, the people of our state are going to forever protect abortion access in Missouri’s constitution."" The ballot measure — which would allow abortions until fetal viability — outlasted 16 other related proposals and months of litigation with Republican state officials. Next, its supporters must gather more than 171,000 valid signatures by May 5. Missouri is one of 13 states weighing abortion-related ballot measures, most of which would protect abortion rights. Abortion rights supporters hope to build on prior ballot wins in seven politically diverse states — California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Ohio and Vermont — since the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned federal abortion protections, handing authority back to states. In a presidential election year, national strategy also steers the money. The success of initiatives could hinge on a state’s relevance to broader party ambitions. Democrats are focused on where anger over the abortion rollback could propel voter turnout and spur party victories up and down the ballot, including in key races for the Senate and White House. Those wins would help guard against what Democrats see as a bigger threat: a national abortion ban. Republicans are quieter about their national strategy around abortion. But at the state level, the groups mounting opposition campaigns are putting foot soldiers on the streets to deter people from signing ballot petitions. Abortion rights supporters have raised millions more for ballot campaigns than have opponents, according to a KFF Health News review of campaign finance records in multiple states. Still, they ""don’t have unlimited resources,"" said Craig Burnett, an associate professor of political science at Hofstra University and expert on ballot initiatives. They must consider, ""Where am I going to get the best bang for my buck here?"" Think Big America, a nonprofit founded by J.B. Pritzker, Illinois’ billionaire Democratic governor, is giving money to abortion rights initiatives in Arizona and Nevada and plans to do so in Montana, senior adviser Mike Ollen said. All are states where abortion remains legal to varying points in pregnancy, but each could have an outsize impact on the national political balance. Arizona and Nevada are presidential swing states viewed as crucial for President Joe Biden to win reelection. They and Montana all have races that could flip control of the U.S. Senate from Democrats to Republicans in 2025. Ollen said electoral consequences are ""part of the calculus"" for Think Big America. ""We want to make sure that we protect abortion in the states that we’re going into,"" Ollen said. ""But we’re also not naive to the threat of a national abortion ban."" About a fifth of key voter groups — Democratic women, women who live in states where abortion is banned, women who plan to vote for Biden, and women of reproductive age — identify as abortion voters, new polling from KFF shows. Anti-abortion groups have pressured Republican candidates to support a national ban. Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump quietly supports a 16-week ban with some exceptions, The New York Times reported. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, one of the nation’s largest anti-abortion groups, said it plans to spend ""$92 million and reach 10 million voters"" to back candidates in the political battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin who would ""protect life across America."" It will focus on ""low turnout and persuadable voters to win the presidency and a majority in Congress."" Ballot initiatives are one way for voters to assert their power over the political whims of state legislatures or courts. They are often viewed as more stable and harder to undo. Abortion rights supporters must fend off statehouse maneuvers by Republicans to thwart ballot initiatives, such as proposals to change how ballot measures are approved or to buttress rules on collecting signatures. Politicians are appealing to the courts to beat back abortion rights. In Montana, abortion is legally protected as a fundamental privacy right by a 1999 court ruling. Still, supporters are seeking to enshrine abortion access in the state constitution with a ballot measure. Republican Attorney General Austin Knudsen, who has unsuccessfully asked the courts to overturn the 1999 precedent, rejected the draft initiative because it places ""multiple distinct political choices into a single initiative."" The initiative’s backers, led by Planned Parenthood of Montana’s chief medical officer, Samuel Dickman, have asked the state Supreme Court to overturn Knudsen’s ruling and allow them to start gathering signatures. Democrats hope the ballot question will drive voter turnout and boost reelection chances for incumbent U.S. Sen. Jon Tester against the likely Republican candidate, Tim Sheehy. Tides Foundation, a social-justice-focused charity based in California, is monitoring ballot campaigns in Montana, Arizona, and Missouri, said Beth Huang, its program officer for civic engagement and democracy. It has granted funds in Florida and is in the process of approving funds for Colorado and Nevada, she said. As a public charity, the group ""legally cannot consider the partisan implications on any set of candidate elections"" in funding decisions, she said. It will fund only ballot measures that would allow abortions at least until fetal viability — generally about 24 weeks — the standard under Roe v. Wade. A proposed initiative in Arkansas is off the table because access would go to 20 weeks. ""We are not interested in policies that do less than reestablish Roe,"" Huang said. In South Dakota, Dakotans for Health wants to reinstate abortion rights in the state. But an anti-abortion campaign says out-of-state money pays for signature drives that pressure people to sign the petitions without providing sufficient information on the measure. The Republican-dominated legislature passed a bill to let people remove their signatures from such ballot petitions. An emergency clause would put the bill into effect immediately if the governor signs it — ahead of the deadline to place the abortion question on the November ballot. Critics of other states’ measures see other avenues for defeat. Gregg Keller, a St. Louis-based Republican political strategist, said Missouri’s proposed amendment goes further than the measure passed last year in Ohio. For example, abortions could be allowed after fetal viability to protect the mental health of a pregnant person. If opponents can get out the word that this goes further than what was done in Ohio and other states, ""we have a chance of actually beating this thing,"" Keller said. ""If they are able to raise money. That’s a big if."" Ballot supporters here raised $4.2 million as of March 12, according to campaign finance records. Money has come from national groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Fairness Project, which has supported ballot efforts on various progressive causes. Kansas City-based Health Forward Foundation has also donated. So far, opponents of the Missouri measure have raised $55,000, nearly half of which comes from the Catholic Church, according to campaign finance records. ""We went into this knowing that we were going to be outspent,"" said Missouri Catholic Conference Executive Director Jamie Morris, who said he didn’t know whether the church would spend more. ""We’re still going to be out trying to educate the faithful as best as we can, with the resources we have."" Abortion Action Missouri Executive Director Mallory Schwarz said the coalition backing the state’s abortion measure is confident it will hit the signature goal by the May deadline. If that happens, it will be up to outgoing Republican Gov. Mike Parson, who supports Missouri’s near-total abortion ban, to decide whether to put the measure before voters in the state’s August primary or the November general election. Keller, the GOP strategist, said the governor will face tremendous pressure to put it on the August ballot. Five of six statewide offices are on the November ballot, as is Republican Josh Hawley’s U.S. Senate seat. An abortion ballot measure could overshadow those campaigns — just based on the war chests in play: Hawley’s 2018 campaign spent about $11.5 million, for example, while the three political action committees backing Ohio’s abortion amendment last year spent more than $50 million. ""I am telling anyone who is running as a Republican this year that if you want to be able to make your case about how and why you deserve to be elected, and you want to be able to get your story out,"" Keller said, ""then clearly you would not want to have a $50 million ballot initiative on in November.""

Cannibalism in Haiti? Fact-checking the unfounded claims,"March 18, 2024",Samantha Putterman,Immigration,"Videos of people fleeing the sounds of gunshots, images of buildings on fire and headlines of political unrest in Haiti have increased over several weeks.

Violence escalated after a coalition of gangs began attacking Haiti’s capital, Port-Au-Prince, forcing acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign. He’d assumed the role after President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in 2021. Amid the real images of chaos lurks a gruesome, unfounded narrative about a culture of cannibalism in Haiti. The Daily Star, a British tabloid, helped kick-start the panic with a March 5 story that said Haitian ""cannibal gangs"" are ""eating people they've killed,"" citing an anonymous Haitian journalist. Conservatives with verified accounts and large platforms, including Elon Musk, the owner of X, amplified the unverified claims on social media and warned of an ""invasion"" of Haitian cannibals in the U.S. ""There are cannibal gangs in Haiti who abduct and eat people,"" Ian Miles Cheong, a right-wing commentator, posted on X on March 6. ""Reminder that these people are now illegally entering the U.S. en masse,"" he added. Online posts in Spanish used the same videos with similar comments. The online rumors coincide with  former President Donald Trump comparing migrants to Hannibal Lecter, the serial killer and cannibal character in ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" during presidential campaign rallies. These posts, however, do not offer evidence that Haitians in the country, or Haitians seeking asylum in the U.S., are practicing cannibalism. The videos Musk and others have shared include outdated videos that either couldn’t be verified or were taken in other countries. The State Department told PolitiFact that it has received no credible reports about cannibalism in Haiti, and experts who study the country said they’ve seen no sign that cannibalism is prevalent among gangs or the population at large. ""There is ZERO evidence that any cannibalism is taking place now, or ever has occurred in the past, in Haiti,"" Marlene Daut, a Yale University professor and Caribbean historian, wrote in an email. ""There is similarly absolutely no evidence that Haitians migrants to the U.S. seeking asylum are ‘cannibalists.’ Those claims are, of course, patently racist and stem from longstanding efforts by white supremacists to dehumanize Haiti and Haitians."" Several videos shared to support the cannibal claims are not connected to Haiti or the current unrest. For example, one video’s depiction of roasting corpses was footage of Halloween decorations at a Chinese theme park in 2018, Snopes reported. Another account shared footage from a 2017 CNN documentary series that interviewed a member of a Hindu sect that includes postmortem cannibalism in its religious practices. The years-old interview is from India. We could not verify another video that appears to show cannibalism. NBC News reported the video had been online ""for two years or longer."" Some X users claimed the clip showed a battle between two gangs in Haiti’s Artibonite Valley. An extensive Google and Nexis search of news articles yielded no evidence of cannibalism in that area. A United Nations report of violence in the region detailed accounts of ""extreme brutality"" by gangs, but did not mention cannibalism. International groups and governments have documented violence in Haiti for decades, publishing extensive reports of the gangs’ violent tactics, which include extortion, indiscriminate murders, kidnappings and rape. PolitiFact found no descriptions of cannibalism.

One of Haiti’s most prominent gang leaders, Jimmy Chérizier, goes by the alias ""Barbecue"" — which is boosting the cannibalism talk. Chérizier told The Associated Press in 2019 that he got his nickname as a child because his mother was a street vendor who sold fried chicken. Although there is plenty of information about Chérizier’s violent tactics — the United Nations sanctioned him over human rights violations — no sources include cannibalism. Narratives painting Haiti as a barbarous country of cannibals are not new. ""These kinds of claims have a long and deep history, and they tend to say more about the people who make them than they do about Haiti itself,"" said Laurent Dubois, a University of Virginia historian. ""There is probably no country in the world that has had more misrepresentations projected onto it than Haiti."" The origin of ""cannibal"" traces back to Italian explorer Christopher Columbus’ voyages in the late 15th century, Dubois said. It came up ""out of a misheard indigenous term (Columbus)  encountered in 1492 when he disembarked in the north of what is now Haiti,"" Dubois said. Stories of cannibalism in Haiti have circulated since. In 2013, historian Mike Dash detailed the story of an 1860s trial over a child’s murder and cannibalism for Smithsonian magazine. The case ""helped define attitudes toward the nation and the (Vodou) ​​religion ever since,"" Dash wrote. Haitian Vodou, rooted in a blend of Catholicism and Western and Central African spirituality, was influenced by escaped slaves in the 17th century who wanted to unite under a common spiritual identity. Neither Haitian culture nor island religious practices support ""anything similar to cannibalism,"" said Athena Kolbe, a social work professor at Barry University and the Institute of Social Work and Social Science in Haiti. Kate Ramsey, a University of Miami history professor, said, ""Such tropes go back to the nineteenth century when, following the Haitian Revolution, colonialist and anti-abolitionist detractors sought to discredit Black self-governance in Haiti through claims about the decline of ‘civilization’ in the second independent nation in the hemisphere and the first to permanently abolish slavery."" Experts pointed to the 19-year U.S. occupation of Haiti between 1915 to 1934 as another flashpoint. U.S. forces were accused of committing atrocities against Haitian people, including shooting civilians, forcing labor and enforcing martial law for long stretches of time. ""The proliferation of negative images about Haiti’s culture played a role in justifying the abuses carried out by the U.S.,"" the University of Virginia’s Dubois said. Unfounded claims of cannibalism in Haiti foment fear of Haitians, especially of ones fleeing brutal violence. There is a ""deep set of unconscious ideas about Haiti that have been developed over a long history,"" Dubois said. And people should be aware of it ""to avoid just falling into recycling old and misleading stereotypes."""
Cuentas en redes sociales usan audio generado por IA para difundir desinformación sobre elecciones,"March 18, 2024",Sara Swann,"Elections, Technology, PolitiFact en Español","Una publicación en redes sociales hizo lo que parecía ser un anuncio sorprendente sobre la carrera presidencial de 2024.

PolitiFact identificó varias cuentas en TikTok esparciendo narrativas falsas sobre las elecciones de 2024 y Trump a través de nuestra colaboración con TikTok para combatir contenido inauténtico, desinformativo o falso. (Lea más sobre nuestra colaboración con TikTok). Videos en YouTube también hicieron afirmaciones similares. Estos videos, los cuales también parecían tener audio generado por IA, fueron compartidos en Facebook y X con menos participación. La IA Generativa es un término amplio que describe cuando computadoras crean nuevo contenido, como texto, fotos, videos y audio, identificando patrones en datos existentes. Este año, los Estados Unidos y más de otros 50 países tienen elecciones nacionales, y es probable que la IA generativa juegue un papel destacado. En febrero en Indonesia, caricaturas generados por IA ayudaron a rehabilitar la imagen de un ex general militar que estaba relacionado a abusos de derechos humanos, quien ganó la elección presidencial en el país. Avances recientes en la AI generativa han hecho más difícil determinar si el contenido en internet es real o falso. Hablamos con expertos sobre cómo esta tecnología está cambiando el panorama de la información y como saber si un audio fue generado por IA. A diferencia de los vídeos, no hay anormalidades visuales que puedan dar señales de manipulación. Cuando contactamos a TikTok para una declaración, un vocero dijo, ""Para aplicar nuestras políticas de desinformación dañina, detectamos el contenido engañoso y lo enviamos a nuestros colaboradores verificadores para una evaluación factual"". Una vez alertados sobre el contenido señalado en esta historia, TikTok lo removió de su plataforma. Le pedimos a expertos en inteligencia artificial generativa que analizaran cinco videos en TikTok que hicieron afirmaciones falsas y engañosas en múltiples cuentas para determinar si habíamos acertado en que el audio había sido generado con IA. Hafiz Malik, un profesor de ingeniería eléctrica y computación que estudia ""deepfakes"" en la Universidad de Michigan-Dearborn, dijo que sus herramientas de detección de IA clasificaron cuatro de los videos como ""sintético"", o audio generado por IA. El quinto fue señalado como de ""baja confianza"", lo cual Malik dice que significa que algunas partes fueron etiquetadas como ""deepfake"", pero otras no. Los videos ""deepfake"" son sofisticados, generados por computadora y dan la impresión que alguien está diciendo o haciendo algo, aun cuando esa persona no dijo o hizo eso. Siwei Lyu, un profesor de informática e ingeniería de la Universidad de Buffalo que se especializa en análisis forense de medios digitales, dijo que sus algoritmos de detección de inteligencia artificial también determinaron que la mayoría de los cinco videos usaron audio generado por IA. Trump fue el foco de estas cuentas en TikTok; varias de las cuentas utilizaron fotos del expresidente como sus fotos de perfil. (Capturas de pantalla de TikTok) Estas cuentas siguieron un esquema similar: titulares llamativos a menudo mostrados sobre fondos rojos; videos que contienen clips o fotos de figuras famosas, incluyendo a Trump y el juez de la Corte Suprema Clarence Thomas; y a un narrador oculto. Algunos de los videos hicieron declaraciones falsas sobre el bienestar de personas de alto perfil — que Trump había tenido un ataque al corazón y que la secretaria de Justicia de Nueva York Letitia James fue hospitalizada por heridas de balas. James demandó a Trump en 2022 acusándolo de inflar fraudulentamente su valor neto; un juez dictó en febrero que Trump debe pagar una multa de $454 millones. Otro video mostraba un texto que decía, ""Juez de la Corte Suprema Clarence Thomas se une a otros jueces para remover al candidato de la carrera de 2024"".  Esto parece referirse engañosamente al caso de la Corte Suprema sobre la elegibilidad de Trump para estar en la boleta de votación, en el cual Thomas y otros jueces dictaron por unanimidad que los estados individuales no pueden suspender a candidatos presidenciales, incluyendo a Trump, de la boleta. (Capturas de pantalla de TikTok) Todas estas cuentas en TikTok fueron creadas en los últimos meses. La que parece más antigua tiene videos de noviembre de 2023; la más nueva comenzó a publicar contenido el 1 de marzo. Tres de las cuentas tenían nombres de usuarios designados por TikTok como ""usuario"" seguido por 13 números. Estas cuentas publicaron colectivamente cientos de videos y obtuvieron miles de vistas y reacciones de me gusta y seguidores, antes de que TikTok removiera las cuentas y videos. También encontramos videos en YouTube haciendo las mismas declaraciones falsas como los videos de TikTok. Estos videos imitaron el formato de los videos en TikTok: titulares sensacionalistas, fotos de Trump, y audio que suena generado por IA. (Capturas de pantalla de YouTube) La mayoría de los videos en YouTube fueron vistos cientos o miles de veces. Las dos cuentas de YouTube que publicaron los videos fueron creadas en 2021 y 2022. Estas cuentas acumularon decenas de miles de seguidores antes de que contactaramos a YouTube por una declaración y la compañía removiera las cuentas de la plataforma. ""Contenido involucrando prácticas engañosas que confunden y se aprovechan de la comunidad de YouTube no es permitido. Como tal, cancelamos los canales de On Point Juicy News and THE BREAK TIME por violar repetidamente nuestras politicas de spam, practicas engañosas y estafas"", dijo Ivy Choi, una vocera de YouTube. Antes de que YouTube eliminara los videos, estos fueron compartidos en otras plataformas de redes sociales, incluyendo Facebook y X, donde pocas personas le dieron me gusta o las vieron. (Lea más sobre nuestra colaboración con Meta, propietaria de Facebook e Instagram). Los expertos en desinformación afirman que las nuevas generaciones de IA generativa están facilitando la creación y difusión de contenidos engañosos en redes sociales. Además, crear audio generado por IA suele ser más barato que el video. ""Ahora, cualquiera con acceso a internet puede disponer del poder de miles de escritores, técnicos de audio y productores de video, de forma gratuita y con sólo pulsar un botón"", afirma Jack Brewster, un editor en NewsGuard, una empresa que rastrea la desinformación en internet. ""En las manos adecuadas, ese poder puede utilizarse para el bien"", dijo Brewster. ""En las manos equivocadas, ese poder puede utilizarse para contaminar nuestro ecosistema de información, desestabilizar las democracias y socavar la confianza pública en las instituciones"". ​​NewsGuard informó en septiembre de 2023 de que se estaba utilizando tecnología de voz de IA para difundir teorías conspirativas en masa a través de TikTok. NewsGuard reportó que ""identificó una red de 17 cuentas de TikTok que utilizaban software de texto a voz de IA para generar videos que avanzaban afirmaciones falsas y sin fundamento, con cientos de millones de visualizaciones."" Un estudio de la Universidad de British Columbia de 2023 que utilizó datos de TikTok descubrió que la tecnología de conversión de texto a voz mediante IA simplificaba la creación de contenidos, motivando a los creadores de contenidos a producir más videos. Los autores del estudio, Xiaoke Zhang y Mi Zhou, dijeron a PolitiFact que el aumento de la productividad significa que la IA generativa ""puede explotarse deliberadamente para generar desinformación a bajo costo"". La tecnología también puede ayudar a los usuarios a ocultar su identidad, lo que puede ""disminuir su sentido de la responsabilidad a la hora de garantizar la exactitud de la información"", señalaron Zhang y Zhou. TikTok exige a los usuarios que etiqueten los contenidos que contienen imágenes, videos o audio generados por IA ""para ayudar a los espectadores a contextualizar el video y evitar la posible difusión de contenidos engañosos."" Las directrices de la comunidad de TikTok prohíben el ""contenido inexacto, engañoso o falso que pueda causar un daño significativo a las personas o a la sociedad"". Ningún video de TikTok que revisamos tenía esta etiqueta de IA generativa, aunque algunos incluían etiquetas para aprender más sobre las elecciones de EE.UU. Brewster dijo que NewsGuard también observó que muchos usuarios de TikTok se saltaban esta política sobre la identificación de contenidos generados por IA. Las directrices de la comunidad de YouTube no permiten ""contenido engañoso que genere riesgos graves de daño flagrante"". YouTube exige la divulgación de la publicidad electoral que contenga ""materiales alterados o generados digitalmente"". La compañía dijo en diciembre que planea ampliar esta divulgación de IA generativa a otros contenidos. Los expertos dicen que las herramientas de detección de IA existentes son imperfectas. Añaden que, a medida que mejoran las herramientas de detección, también lo hace la tecnología de IA generativa. El audio generado por IA carece de señales visuales que se observan en videos,  como los movimientos de la boca que no están sincronizados con el audio o los rasgos físicos distorsionados. Sin embargo, hay formas de identificar el audio generado por IA. Malik, profesor de la Universidad de Michigan, dice que hay que prestar atención a las anomalías en el tono vocal, la articulación o el ritmo. ""(Las voces generadas por IA) carecen de emociones. Carecen de las subidas y bajadas de volumen que se producen normalmente al hablar"", dijo Malik. ""Son bastante monótonas"". Brewster también aconsejó que las ""viejas tácticas"" siguen siendo la mejor manera de evitar la desinformación generada por la IA. Por ejemplo: Contrastar la información con la de otros sitios Estar atento a los errores gramaticales y a las expresiones extrañas Buscar los nombres de los autores para ver si han compartido información falsa en el pasado.

In Context: What Trump said about a ‘bloodbath’ and Biden’s actions on the car industry,"March 18, 2024",Amy Sherman,"National, Elections","The word du jour in the 2024 presidential campaign is ""bloodbath"" — specifically, what former President Donald Trump did or didn't mean when he used the term at a March 16 Ohio rally. President Joe Biden’s campaign team plucked a nine-second clip of Trump saying, ""If I don't get elected, it’s gonna be a bloodbath for the whole, that’s going to be the least of it. It’s going to be a bloodbath for the country, that'll be the least of it"" and framed it as violent rhetoric. The Biden campaign posted March 16 on X: ""Donald Trump said there would be a ‘bloodbath’ if he wasn’t elected and that if he lost there would be no more elections."" The next day, Biden’s account shared on X the ""bloodbath"" clip and wrote, ""It’s clear this guy wants another January 6."" Without context, some voters could assume that Trump’s ""bloodbath"" remarks were predicting violence by his supporters should he lose at the polls. On Truth Social, Trump responded March 18 that the media and Democrats ""pretended to be shocked at my use of the word BLOODBATH, even though they fully understood that I was simply referring to imports"" allowed by Biden ""which are killing the automobile industry."" Politicians, pundits and social media users debated Trump’s ""bloodbath"" remark in the days following the speech. Some major news outlets including The New York Times, ABC and The Associated Press wrote that Trump warned of a ""bloodbath"" in headlines without the auto industry context. Although the text of the articles explained the context, when headlines alone are shared on social media, it doesn’t tell the full story. The Biden campaign told PolitiFact the term needed to be considered alongside Trump’s other rhetoric in this speech, pointing to Trump’s comments about people imprisoned after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. More than 1,350 defendants have been charged in the attack, including hundreds for assaulting police officers or using deadly weapons. Trump called them ""hostages,"" even though they are being given due process — something that former Vice President Mike Pence and former Trump aide Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also pointed out in March 17 Sunday shows. Given the focus on Trump’s rally, we wanted to provide full context for the ""bloodbath"" remark and his comments about not having elections if he loses and the Jan. 6 defendants. Trump spoke for more than 90 minutes in Vandalia, Ohio, days before the state’s March 19 U.S. Senate primary. Trump endorsed businessman Bernie Moreno in the Republican contest. About 28 minutes into the speech, Trump talked about Biden’s plans for electric vehicles harming the U.S. auto industry. The Biden administration has set a goal to have electric vehicles comprise half of all new vehicle sales by 2030 and offered significant aid to the U.S. auto sector to keep it competitive in the electric vehicle marketplace. Recent news reports, based on unnamed sources, have said Biden is poised to relax elements of his plan. The relevant portion of Trump’s remarks (around minute 33 in this video) started with a critique of the United Auto Workers union, which endorsed Biden in this year’s election: ""But if you look at the United Auto Workers, what they've done to their people is horrible. They want to do this all-electric nonsense where the cars don't go far. They cost too much. And they’re all made in China. And the head of the United Auto Workers never probably shook hands with a Republican before they're destroying — you know, Mexico has taken, over a period of 30 years, 34% of the automobile manufacturing business in our country, think of it, went to Mexico. ""China now is building a couple of massive plants, where they're going to build the cars in Mexico and … they think that they're going to sell those cars into the United States with no tax at the border. Let me tell you something to China. If you're listening, President Xi, and you and I are friends, but he understands the way I deal, those big, monster car manufacturing plants that you're building in Mexico right now, and you think you're going to get that, you're going to not hire Americans, and you're going to sell the cars to us, no. We're going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you're not going to be able to sell those cars. ""If I get elected. Now, if I don't get elected, it's gonna be a bloodbath for the whole, that's going to be the least of it. It's going to be a bloodbath for the country. That'll be the least of it. But they're not gonna sell those cars."" Trump went on to talk about cars being manufactured in Mexico and his promise to institute ""100% tariffs"" on cars manufactured outside the United States. About 20 minutes later, Trump turned his comments to stopping ""Joe Biden and his thugs."" ""We're the only ones, and they know this, that could stop them. We’re the only ones, there's nobody else around. If this election, if this election isn’t won, I'm not sure that you'll ever have another election in this country. Does that make sense? I don't think you're going to have another election in this country if we don't win this election. I don't think you're going to have another election or certainly not an election that's meaningful."" Along with his warnings about elections, Trump also repeated his support for the Jan. 6 defendants, a signature talking point at his rallies. Before Trump spoke at the Ohio rally, an announcer said, ""Please rise for the horribly and unfairly treated January 6 hostages."" The crowd then heard a recording of the ""The Star Spangled Banner"" performed by the J6 Prison Choir, men jailed for their actions during the Capitol riot. Trump saluted and then said at the rally, ""Thank you very much, and you see the spirit from the hostages and that's what they are as hostages. They've been treated terribly and very unfairly and you know that and everybody knows that. And we're going to be working on that soon. The first day we get into office we are going to save our country and we are going to work with the people to treat those unbelievable patriots, and they were unbelievable patriots and are.""

"Four years after shelter-in-place, COVID-19 misinformation persists","March 15, 2024",Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu,"Public Health, Facebook Fact-checks, Coronavirus","From spring break parties to Mardi Gras, many people remember the last major ""normal"" thing they did before the novel coronavirus pandemic dawned, forcing governments worldwide to issue stay-at-home advisories and shutdowns. Even before the first case of COVID-19 was detected in the U.S., fears and uncertainties helped spur misinformation’s rapid spread. In March 2020, schools closed, employers sent staff to work from home and grocery stores called for social distancing to keep people safe. But little halted the flow of misleading claims that sent fact-checkers and public health officials into overdrive.

Some people falsely asserted COVID-19’s symptoms were associated with 5G wireless technology. Faux cures and untested treatments populated social media and political discourse. Amid uncertainty about the virus’s origins, some even proclaimed COVID-19 didn’t exist at all. PolitiFact named downplay and denial about the virus its 2020 Lie of the Year. Four years later, people’s lives are largely free of the extreme public health measures that restricted them early in the pandemic. But COVID-19 misinformation persists, although it’s now centered mostly on vaccines and vaccine-related conspiracy theories. PolitiFact has published more than 2,000 fact-checks related to COVID-19 vaccines alone. ""From a misinformation researcher perspective, [there has been] shifting levels of trust,"" said Tara Kirk Sell, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""Early on in the pandemic, there was a lot of: ‘this isn’t real,’ fake cures, and then later on, we see more vaccine-focused mis- and disinformation and a more partisan type of disinformation and misinformation."" Here are some of the most persistent COVID-19 misinformation narratives we see today: COVID-19 vaccines were quickly developed, with U.S. patients receiving the first shots in December 2020, 11 months after the first domestic case was detected. Experts credit the speedy development with helping to save millions of lives and preventing hospitalizations. Researchers at the University of Southern California and Brown University calculated that vaccines saved 2.4 million lives in 141 countries from January 2021 to August 2021 alone. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows there were 574 U.S. deaths attributed to COVID-19 the week of March 2, down from nearly 26,000 at the pandemic’s height in January 2021, as vaccines were just rolling out. But on social media and in some public officials’ remarks, misinformation about COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and safety is common. U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. built his 2024 campaign on a movement that seeks to legitimize conspiracy theories about the vaccines. We made that our 2023 Lie of the Year. PolitiFact has seen claims that spike proteins from vaccines are replacing sperm in vaccinated males. (That’s False.) We’ve researched the assertion that vaccines can change your DNA. (That’s misleading and ignores evidence). Social media posts poked fun at Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce for encouraging people to get vaccinated, asserting that the vaccine actually shuts off recipients’ hearts. (No, it doesn’t.)  And some people pointed to an American Red Cross blood donation questionnaire as evidence that shots are unsafe. (We rated that False.) Experts say this misinformation has real-world effects. A Nov. 2023 survey by KFF found that only 57% of Americans ""say they are very or somewhat confident"" in COVID-19 vaccines. And those who distrust them are more likely to identify as politically conservative: Thirty-six percent of Republicans compared with 84% of Democrats say they are very or somewhat confident in the vaccine. Immunization rates for routine vaccines for other conditions have also taken a hit. Measles had been eradicated for more than 20 years in the U.S. but there have been recent outbreaks in states including Florida, Maryland and Ohio. Florida’s surgeon general has expressed skepticism about vaccines and rejected guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about how to contain potentially deadly disease spread. The vaccination rate among kindergarteners has declined from 95% in the 2019-20 school year to 93% in 2022-23, according to the CDC. Public health officials have set a 95% vaccination rate target to prevent and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks. The CDC also found exemptions had risen to 3%, the highest rate ever recorded in the U.S. PolitiFact has seen repeated and unsubstantiated claims that COVID-19 vaccines have caused mass numbers of deaths. A recent widely shared post claimed 17 million people had died because of the vaccine, despite contrary evidence from multiple studies and institutions such as the World Health Organization and CDC that the vaccines are safe and help to prevent severe illness and death. Another online post claimed the booster vaccine had eight strains of HIV and would kill 23% of the population. Vaccine manufacturers publish the ingredient lists; they do not include HIV. People living with HIV were among the people given priority access during early vaccine rollout to protect them from severe illness. We have also seen COVID-19 vaccines blamed for causing Alzheimer’s and cancer. Experts have found no evidence the vaccines cause either conditions. ""​​You had this remarkable scientific or medical accomplishment contrasted with this remarkable rejection of that technology by a significant portion of the American public,"" said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. About 70% of Americans have completed a primary series of COVID-19 vaccination, more than three years after they became available, according to CDC figures. About 17% have gotten the most recent bivalent booster. False claims often pull from and misuse data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. The database, run by the CDC and Food and Drug Administration, allows anybody to report reactions after any vaccine. The reports themselves are unverified, but the database is designed to help researchers find patterns for further investigation. A November 2023 survey published by Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania found 63% of Americans think ""it is safer to get the COVID-19 vaccine than the COVID-19 disease"" — that was down from 75% in April 2021. Betty White, Bob Saget, Matthew Perry, and DMX are just a few of the many celebrities whose deaths were falsely linked to the vaccine. The anti-vaccine film ""Died Suddenly""  tried to give credence to false claims that the vaccine causes people to die shortly after receiving it. Dr. Céline Gounder, editor at large for public health at KFF Health News and an infectious disease specialist, said these claims proliferate because of two things —  cognitive bias and more insidious motivated reasoning. ""It's like saying ‘I had an ice cream cone and then I died the next day, the ice cream must have killed me,"" she said. And those with pre-existing beliefs about the vaccine seek to attach sudden deaths to the vaccine. Gounder experienced this  personally when her husband, the celebrated sports journalist Grant Wahl, died while covering the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Wahl died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm but anti-vax accounts falsely linked his death to the COVID-19 vaccine, forcing Gounder to publicly set the record straight. ""It is very clear that this is about harming other people,"" said Gounder, who was a guest at United Facts of America in 2023. ""And in this case, trying to harm me and my family at a point where we were grieving my husband's loss. What was important in that moment was to really stand up for my husband, his legacy, and to do what I know he would have wanted me to do, which is to speak the truth and to do so very publicly."" We continue to see false claims that the pandemic was planned by government leaders and those in power. At any given moment, Microsoft Corp. co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, World Economic Forum Chair Klaus Schwab and former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci are blamed for orchestrating pandemic-related threats.

In February, Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., falsely claimed Fauci, ""brought"" the virus to his state a  year before the pandemic.  There is no evidence of that. Gates, according to the narratives, is using dangerous vaccines to push a depopulation agenda. That’s False. And Schwab has not said he has an ""agenda"" to establish a totalitarian global regime using the coronavirus to depopulate the earth and reorganize society. That’s part of a conspiracy theory that’s come to be called ""The Great Reset"" that has been debunked many times. The United Nations’ World Health Organization is frequently painted as a global force for evil, too, with detractors saying it is using vaccination to control or harm people. But the WHO has not declared that a new pandemic is happening, as some have claimed. Its current pandemic preparedness treaty is in no way positioned to remove human rights protections or restrict freedoms, as one post said. And the organization has not announced plans to deploy troops to corral people and forcibly vaccinate them. The WHO is, however, working on a new treaty to help countries improve coordination in response to future pandemics."
Can you ‘say gay’ in Florida schools? Explaining new settlement over LGBTQ+ ‘instruction’,"March 14, 2024",Grace Abels,"Legal Issues, LGBTQ, Florida","Two years after Florida’s governor received national attention over a new law restricting LGBTQ+ instruction in schools, the state reached a settlement with plaintiffs who said the law was unconstitutional. Critics and some media outlets panned the law, nicknaming it ""Don’t Say Gay."" LGBTQ+ advocates sued over the measure, saying it was vague enough that classroom teachers feared being targeted and fired for merely mentioning their gay partners or for discussing LGBTQ+ identity in the classroom. As news of a settlement over the Parental Rights in Education Act broke March 11, both sides appeared to proclaim victory.

""After nearly 2 years of fighting DeSantis’ ​""Don’t Say ​Gay or Trans"" law in the courts, we’ve reached a historic settlement with the state that puts an end to some of the most dangerous impacts of ​this law for students, parents, & teachers,"" statewide LGBTQ+ advocacy group Equality Florida, one of the plaintiffs, said on X.

Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office, meanwhile, issued a press release declaring the settlement ""a major win against the activists who sought to stop Florida’s efforts to keep radical gender and sexual ideology out of the classrooms.""

""Their judicial activism has failed,"" the press release said. ""Today’s mutually agreed settlement ensures that the law will remain in effect."" DeSantis signed the legislation into law in March 2022. It prohibited ""classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity"" in kindergarten to third grade ""or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards."" The Florida Board of Education later expanded the law’s applicability through grade 12.

When LGBTQ+ advocates and others dubbed the measure ""don't say gay,"" Republicans pushed back. The bill never says the word ""gay"" is not allowed in school, although advocates argued the law would send a message that could extend beyond lesson plans and assigned readings into what teachers can say about their families, what photos can be displayed in classrooms or what books can be on shelves. The eight-page court settlement does not change the statute’s text, but seeks to clarify what falls under its purview. The state in filings to plaintiffs had already argued many of the points the court settlement expanded upon. The settlement requires all Florida school boards to receive a copy. One LGBTQ+ advocate noted, however, that the settlement does not require districts to reexamine or change policies they may have already enacted in response to the law. Here are four things we learned from reading the settlement: The settlement says the ""statute restricts only teaching on the topics of sexual orientation and gender identity in a classroom setting,"" not ""mere discussion of them."" ""Typical class participation and schoolwork are not ‘instruction,’"" it says. Teachers may not use books to teach about sexual orientation or gender identity. But they would be ""free to ‘respond if students discuss … their identities or family life,’"" and ""provide grades and feedback,"" if a student, for example, writes an essay about their LGBTQ+ identity, the settlement says.

Students and teachers can refer to a person’s family. And the law does not prohibit gay teachers from keeping photos of their spouses on their desks. ""Just as no one would suggest that references to numbers in a history book constitute ‘instruction on mathematics,"" the statute does not prohibit ""incidental references in literature"" to LGBTQ+ identity, the settlement says.

Such references do not violate the statute ""any more than a math problem asking students to add bushels of apples is ‘instruction on’ apple farming,"" the settlement says. The law does not prevent school employees from intervening in bullying cases that target  LGBTQ+ students. Employees need not remove ""safe space stickers,"" because they do not amount to classroom instruction. Gay-Straight Alliance clubs are not prohibited either under this statute. The law applies equally to instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity, whether it is LGBTQ+ or not. ""The statute does not target ‘sexual orientations and gender identities that differ from heterosexual and cisgender identities,’"" the settlement says. ""For example, it would violate that statute to instruct students that heterosexuality is superior or that gender identity is immutable based on biological traits."" Attorney Simone Chriss, director of the Transgender Rights Initiative at Southern Legal Counsel Inc., who is in litigation with the state over other LGBTQ+ matters, told PolitiFact that she is concerned that the settlement’s language is contradicted by another legislative measure that became law in 2023. H.B. 1069 says, ""It shall be the policy of every public K-12 educational institution that is provided or authorized by the Constitution and laws of Florida that a person's sex is an immutable biological trait and that it is false to ascribe to a person a pronoun that does not correspond to such person's sex."" Although the Parental Rights in Education Act may not pertain to library books because they aren’t in themselves ""classroom instruction,"" the settlement clarifies that other sections of Florida law that govern these materials remain in effect. The settlement doesn’t affect 2022 legislation that has been used to remove books from libraries, for example.

Also, H.B. 1069, prohibits the use of gender-affirming pronouns and honorifics in schools. That means transgender teachers still face limitations on how they communicate with students."
Social media accounts use AI-generated audio to push 2024 election misinformation,"March 13, 2024",Sara Swann,"Elections, Technology, Facebook Fact-checks","A recent social media post made what appeared to be a surprising announcement about the 2024 presidential race. ""Breaking news: Donald Trump has declared that he is pulling out of the run for president,"" the narrator said in a Feb. 22 TikTok video, which was viewed more than 161,000 times before TikTok removed it from the platform. Of course, Trump hasn’t dropped out of the 2024 race. As of March 12, he’d secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican presidential nomination. Besides the false claim, the video had another distinctive element: The audio appeared to be made with artificial intelligence. PolitiFact identified several TikTok accounts spreading false narratives about the 2024 election and Trump through its partnership with TikTok to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.) Videos on YouTube made similar false claims. These videos, which also appeared to have AI-generated audio, were reshared with lower engagement on Facebook and X. Generative AI is a broad term that describes when computers create new content, such as text, photos, videos and audio, by identifying patterns in existing data. This year, the United States and more than 50 other countries are holding national elections, and generative AI is likely to play an outsized role. In February in Indonesia, AI-generated cartoons helped rehabilitate the image of a former military general linked to human rights abuses, who won the country’s presidential election. Recent advances in generative AI have made it harder to determine whether online content is real or fake. We talked to experts about how this technology is changing the information landscape and how to spot AI-generated audio. Unlike video, there aren’t visual abnormalities that can hint at manipulation. When contacted for comment, a TikTok spokesperson said, ""To apply our harmful misinformation policies, we detect misleading content and send it to fact-checking partners for factual assessment."" Once alerted to the content highlighted in this story, TikTok removed it from the platform. We asked generative AI experts to analyze five TikTok videos that made false and misleading claims across multiple accounts to determine whether we’d accurately surmised that the audio was AI-generated. Hafiz Malik, a University of Michigan-Dearborn electrical and computer engineering professor who studies deepfakes, said his AI detection tool classified four of the videos as ""synthetic,"" or AI-generated, audio. The fifth was flagged as ""low confidence,"" which Malik said means some parts were labeled as ""deepfake,"" while others weren’t. Siwei Lyu, a University at Buffalo computer science and engineering professor who specializes in digital media forensics, said his AI detection algorithms also classified a majority of the five videos as using AI-generated audio. Trump was a focus of these TikTok accounts; several of the accounts used photos of the former president as their profile photos. (Screengrabs from TikTok) These accounts followed a similar playbook: eye-catching headlines often displayed against red backgrounds; videos containing clips or still photos of famous figures, including Trump and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas; and a disembodied narrator. Some videos made false claims about the well-being of high-profile people — that Trump had a heart attack and New York Attorney General Letitia James was hospitalized for gunshot wounds. James sued Trump in 2022 accusing him of fraudulently inflating his net worth; a judge ruled in February that Trump must pay a $454 million penalty. Another video displayed text reading, ""Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas joins other justices to remove 2024 race candidate."" This appears to misleadingly refer to the Supreme Court’s case on Trump’s ballot eligibility, in which Thomas and the other justices unanimously ruled that individual states cannot bar presidential candidates, including Trump, from the ballot. (Screengrabs from TikTok) All of these TikTok accounts were created within the past few months. The one that appeared the oldest had videos dating to November 2023; the newest began posting content March 1. Three of the accounts had TikTok’s default username of ""user"" followed by 13 numbers. These accounts collectively posted hundreds of videos and garnered hundreds of thousands of views, likes and followers before TikTok removed the accounts and videos. We also found videos making the same false claims as the TikTok videos on YouTube. These videos mimicked the TikTok videos’ format: sensational headlines, Trump photos, audio that sounded AI-generated. (Screengrabs from YouTube) Most of the YouTube videos were viewed hundreds or thousands of times. The two YouTube accounts that posted the videos were created in 2021 and 2022 and amassed tens of thousands of followers before we contacted YouTube for comment and the company removed the accounts from the platform. Before YouTube removed the videos, they were reshared on other social media platforms, including Facebook and X, where very small numbers of people liked or viewed them. (Read more about our partnership with Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.) A YouTube spokesperson did not provide comment for this story by our deadline. Misinformation experts say the newest generations of generative AI are making it easier for people to create and share misleading social media content. And AI-generated audio tends to be cheaper than its video counterparts. ""Now, anyone with access to the internet can have the power of thousands of writers, audio technicians and video producers, for free, and at the push of a button,"" said Jack Brewster, enterprise editor at Newsguard, a company tracking online misinformation. ""In the right hands, that power can be used for good,"" Brewster said. ""In the wrong hands, that power can be used to pollute our information ecosystem, destabilize democracies and undermine public trust in institutions."" NewsGuard reported in September 2023 that AI voice technology was being used to spread conspiracy theories en masse across TikTok. The report said Newsguard ""identified a network of 17 TikTok accounts using AI text-to-speech software to generate videos advancing false and unsubstantiated claims, with hundreds of millions of views."" A 2023 University of British Columbia study that used a dataset from TikTok found that AI text-to-speech technology simplified content creation, motivating content creators to produce more videos. Study authors Xiaoke Zhang and Mi Zhou told PolitiFact that increased productivity means generative AI ""can be deliberately exploited to generate misinformation at a low cost."" The technology can also help users conceal their identities, which can ""diminish their sense of responsibility towards ensuring information accuracy,"" Zhang and Zhou said. TikTok requires users to label content that contains AI-generated images, videos or audio ""to help viewers contextualize the video and prevent the potential spread of misleading content."" TikTok’s community guidelines bar ""inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society."" No TikTok videos we reviewed had this generative AI label, although some included labels to learn more about U.S. elections. Brewster said NewsGuard also observed many TikTok users bypassing this policy about identifying AI-generated content. YouTube’s community guidelines don’t allow ""misleading or deceptive content that poses a serious risk of egregious harm."" YouTube requires disclosure for election advertising containing ""digitally altered or generated materials."" The company said in December that it plans to expand this generative AI disclosure to other content. Experts say existing AI detection tools are imperfect. They add that as detection tools improve, so does generative AI technology. AI-generated audio lacks the more obvious visual cues of AI-generated images or videos, such as mouth movements that aren’t synced to audio or distorted physical features. However, there are ways people can identify AI-generated audio. Malik, the University of Michigan-Dearborn professor, said to listen for abnormalities in vocal tone, articulation or pacing. ""(AI-generated voices) lack emotions. They lack the rise and fall in the audio that you typically have when you talk,"" Malik said. ""They are pretty monotonic."" Brewster also advised that the ""old tactics"" are still the best way to avoid AI-generated misinformation. Those include cross-checking information with other sites; being attuned to grammatical errors and odd phrasing; and searching for the names of those who posted to see if they have shared false information in the past.

Lawmakers shared misleading claims at Robert Hur hearing on Biden classified documents,"March 12, 2024",Matthew Crowley,"Congress, Legal Issues","Testifying before Congress, former Special Counsel Robert Hur defended his February report detailing Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents, saying it neither exonerated nor disparaged the current president. House Judiciary Committee members compared and contrasted Biden’s case with former President Donald Trump’s classified documents investigation. In his report, Hur concluded that criminal charges were not warranted but criticized Biden’s practices in handling sensitive documents. Hur wrote that his investigation found evidence that Biden had ""willfully retained and disclosed classified materials"" as a private citizen after serving as vice president. During the March 12 hearing in Washington, Democratic lawmakers said Biden cooperated with investigators whereas Trump tried to thwart them. Republican lawmakers countered that Biden was treated differently from Trump. ""But then you apply this senile cooperator theory, that because Joe Biden cooperated and the elevator didn’t go to the top floor, you don’t think you get a conviction,"" Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. said. Hur defended his report’s characterization of Biden’s faulty memory. ""I could not make that determination without assessing the president’s state of mind,"" he said. The release of the transcript of interviews between Hur’s team and Biden also shed new light on an exchange about Biden’s deceased son, Beau Biden. We fact-checked a few claims made by lawmakers that were missing context or misleading. Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif.: ""Here's the problem: Donald Trump is being prosecuted for exactly the same act that you've documented that Joe Biden committed."" This is misleading. Trump was indicted in June 2023 on about three dozen counts, including willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements. ""Trump’s indictment alleges a pattern of deliberate and willful behavior and lying to federal investigators that Hur does not find in the Biden investigation,"" Joan Meyer, who has worked as a federal and local level prosecutor and is now a partner at the law firm Thompson Hine LLP, told PolitiFact. Hur’s report drew several distinctions between his Biden investigation and Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigation of Trump’s handling of classified documents. Hur wrote in his report that Trump’s case had ""several material distinctions"" from Biden’s, including that Biden cooperated with the investigation while Trump thwarted federal efforts to retrieve documents. Biden ""turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations including his homes, sat for a voluntary interview, and in other ways cooperated with the investigation,"" Hur wrote. Biden’s lawyers discovered the documents Nov. 2, 2022, and notified the National Archives and Records Administration the same day. Hur wrote that according to Trump’s indictment, the former president ""not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it."" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.: ""The Hur report represents the complete and total exoneration of President Biden."" Multiple former prosecutors told us that prosecutors typically recommend for or against prosecution but do not ""exonerate."" The Merriam-Webster dictionary says exonerate ""implies a complete clearance from an accusation or charge and from any attendant suspicion of blame or guilt."" Hur didn’t use the word ""exonerate"" in his report, and he pointed that out during his testimony. ""That is not a word I use in the report and that’s not part of my task as a prosecutor,"" Hur said after U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., repeated the term. ""Hur’s report finds insufficient evidence to prosecute President Biden because the evidence he generated is not likely to secure a criminal conviction,"" Meyer said. ""That is the standard that federal prosecutors use to determine whether to charge. Declining to charge is not the same as exonerating a defendant. Prosecutors only determine if the weight of the evidence supports prosecution and conviction beyond a reasonable doubt."" Kendall Coffey, a former U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Florida, agreed that prosecutors do not typically describe a decision not to bring charges as an ""exoneration."" He said a prosecutor might use the term ""exonerate"" when there is a determination of innocence through evidence such as DNA, rather than simply a decision not to prosecute. Nadler’s mention of ""exoneration"" was a reference to Trump, who said Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 2019 report ""exonerated"" Trump of colluding with Russia to tip the 2016 presidential election in his favor. Mueller said the report hadn’t done so. Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa.: ""Your report on Page 208 says that Mr. Biden couldn't come up with the date, the year, of his son Beau Biden's death, when in fact in the transcript it shows that you asked him the month. And you know what he said Mr. Hur? He said, ‘Oh, God, May 30.’ Would you like to correct the record? His memory was pretty firm on the month and the day."" The transcript of Hur’s interview with Biden didn't show Hur asking what month Beau Biden died. But Biden did identify the month and day unprompted. Hur asked Biden about where he kept papers related to a book in progress and a cancer research initiative. Biden responded with a story that started with him asking Hur whether the time frame in question was ""2017, 2018, that area?"" Hur said yes. Biden answered, ""Remember, in this time frame, my son is — either been deployed or is dying,"" and discussed his thinking about running for president. Then Biden said, ""And, and so what was happening, though — what month did Beau die? Oh, God, May 30th."" Two other people in the room, one named and one unnamed in the transcript, entered the conversation, saying, ""2015."" Biden: ""Was it 2015 he had died?"" An unidentified male speaker said, ""It was May of 2015."" Biden: ""It was 2015."" Hur wrote in his report that Joe Biden ""did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died."" Biden later recounted this conversation at a Feb. 8 press conference and said the special counsel asked him a question about Beau’s death, even though the transcript shows that is not how Beau Biden’s name came up during the interview. ""I know there’s some attention paid to some language in the report about my recollection of events. There’s even a reference that I don’t remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn’t any of their damn business,"" Biden said. Hur’s lawyer, William Burck, said Dean’s ""implication was that he had asked Biden when his son died. The transcript speaks for itself. Hur did not ask him that.""

Princess Kate’s altered photo: What experts say happened and how to spot manipulated content online,"March 12, 2024",Samantha Putterman,"National, Technology","Princess Kate had not been seen in public for weeks when Kensington Palace marked the United Kingdom’s Mother’s Day by releasing a photo of the princess of Wales surrounded by her three smiling children. ""Thank you for your kind wishes and continued support over the last two months. Wishing everyone a Happy Mother's Day. C,"" read the March 10 post that accompanied the image on the prince and princess of Wales’ X account. The Associated Press withdrew the image hours later and issued a ""kill order"" for it, asking clients to remove it from their platforms over concerns it had been manipulated ""by the source."" Other news agencies including Getty, Reuters, Agence France-Presse and Britain’s national news agency, PA, soon followed suit.

The palace announced in January that the princess was undergoing a ""planned abdominal surgery"" that required a two-week hospital stay and a pause in her royal duties until Easter. She hasn’t been seen in public since Christmas. Scant information about the surgery and the long recovery period fueled frantic conspiracy theories about Middleton’s whereabouts, and whether the procedure was more serious. The new image sent the rumor mill into overdrive. In a March 11 post on the Kensington X account, a message signed by Kate apologized for the doctored photo, saying that ""like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing."" ""I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day. C,"" the post said. The photo was credited to her husband, William, prince of Wales and heir to the throne, and the palace said the photo was taken earlier in the week in Windsor, where the family lives. A palace official told The New York Times that Kate made minor adjustments and reiterated that, although William had taken the photo, Kate edited it. Forensic image experts pointed to several inconsistencies in the image, including details where sleeves and zippers don’t line up. They agreed it doesn’t look like an AI-generated image, but was subject to more rudimentary photo editing. ""It looks to me like it is a composite image that may have been taken from multiple photos — a common technique used to get the best versions of individual subjects,"" said Cole Whitecotton, senior professional research assistant for the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado, Denver. ""Many new phones automatically do stuff like this for things like red-eye removal, making sure subjects aren’t blinking, etc. Nothing we have seen in the image seems like particularly malicious edits. Clearly, not much time was put into the edits as you can see the clear traces left behind."" Digital forensic researchers at the University of Colorado, Denver, pointed out inconsistencies in the image of Princess Kate with her children. (Courtesy of the University of Colorado, Denver) Mounir Ibrahim, executive vice president of TruePic, which creates tools to verify the authenticity of online content, said it appears that the photo was edited with a tool like Adobe Creative Cloud and looks like a ""cheap fake,"" which is usually done with rudimentary editing like cropping, filtering and taking existing pictures and placing them into images, he said. ""You can add in generative fill into an existing cheap fake, so it's not impossible that pieces of this photo are synthetic, like the background or color,"" he said. ""But this does not appear to be a completely synthetic image; it seems as though pieces of an old image were used or recycled."" One royal photographer told the BBC that editing photos isn’t an unusual practice in royal photography, but said the press’s withdrawal of the image ""was definitely new."" The AP said there was no suggestion that the image was fake, but the agency retracted it because it didn’t meet its photo standards, which state that images must be accurate and not altered. The news organization said its editors determined after further inspection that the image showed an ""inconsistency in the alignment of Princess Charlotte’s left hand with the sleeve of her sweater."" Minor editing, such as cropping and color adjustments, are acceptable when necessary for clear reproduction, but should ""maintain the authentic nature of the photograph,"" the news organization wrote in a March 11 article explaining the decision. ""Changes in density, contrast, color and saturation levels that substantially alter the original scene are not acceptable,"" the story said. ""Backgrounds should not be digitally blurred or eliminated by burning down or by aggressive toning. The removal of ‘red eye’ from photographs is not permissible."" Knowing how these technologies work and having a healthy amount of skepticism is important when looking at any information online. ""It is good to question sources (and) look deeper into multimedia that is shared with you,"" Whitecotton said. ""Having an understanding of how digital technologies work, understanding how the pipeline of content creation works, how these images are being made and put out into the world, etc."" Editing tools can sometimes leave traces, experts said, so taking the time to zoom in and see if anything appears unusual can reveal whether content is doctored. In this case, internet users zeroed in on Princess Charlotte’s sleeve, which has a portion missing. Courtesy of the University of Colorado, Denver Reverse-image searches are helpful and typically easy using websites like Google Images or TinEye. These searches can reveal a photo’s original source and whether it has been edited or shared in the past. Unnatural skin tones, or blurred-out features are other indications that an image may be fake or altered. In the royal family’s photo, Catherine’s right hand appears blurry, while her face and left hand are in focus. Experts also recommend examining shadows, reflections and perspective lines to spot irregularities. If a pattern doesn’t intersect at the right place, that could be a tell-tale sign that it’s altered. Courtesy of the University of Colorado, Denver As generative AI and other digital editing tools become more sophisticated, experts said it will be more difficult to spot fake or manipulated content. The news industry, photo specialists and tech platforms are trying new things in response, including infrastructure like content credentials — icons or watermarks on content that would provide a kind of ""digital nutrition label."" This would tell people where and when the content was created, what tools were used to make it, whether generative AI was used and any edits made along the way. As more platforms and tools adopt this, experts believe it has the potential to become a reliable standard. Jevin West, associate professor and co-founder at the University of Washington’s Information School and co-director of its DataLab, said the response has extended to ""the hardware level."" Camera companies are starting to equip cameras with the ability to create digital watermarks. West said these initiatives are helpful and can ""start to set some norms to producing images and stories that have public relevance and interest."" Although this is positive progress, West said, he warned people to be watchful, especially in an election year. ""This is a big year. We need to bring public attention to it and consumers should remain extra vigilant,"" he said. ""There are really consequential decisions happening around the world, all at a time when AI is rising and becoming more sophisticated and making it harder to tell what's real or not.""

Why COVID-19 patients who could most benefit from Paxlovid still aren’t getting it,"March 11, 2024",Arthur Allen,"Public Health, Health Check, Coronavirus","Evangelical minister Eddie Hyatt believes in the healing power of prayer but ""also the medical approach."" So on a February evening a week before scheduled prostate surgery, he had his sore throat checked out at an emergency room near his home in Grapevine, Texas. A doctor confirmed that Hyatt had COVID-19 and sent him to CVS with a prescription for the antiviral drug Paxlovid, the generally recommended medicine to fight COVID-19. Hyatt handed the pharmacist the script, but then, he said, ""She kept avoiding me."" She finally looked up from her computer and said, ""It’s $1,600."" The generally healthy 76-year-old went out to the car to consult his wife about their credit card limits. ""I don’t think I’ve ever spent more than $20 on a prescription,"" the astonished Hyatt recalled. That kind of sticker shock has stunned thousands of sick Americans since late December, as Pfizer shifted to commercial sales of Paxlovid. Before then, the federal government covered the cost of the drug. The price is one reason Paxlovid is not reaching those who need it most. And patients who qualify for free doses, which Pfizer offers under an agreement with the federal government, often don’t realize it or know how to get them. ""If you want to create a barrier to people getting a treatment, making it cost a lot is the way to do it,"" said William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and spokesperson for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Public and medical awareness of Paxlovid’s benefits is low, and putting people through an application process to get the drug when they’re sick is a nonstarter, Schaffner said. Pfizer says it takes only five minutes online. It’s not an easy drug to use. Doctors are wary about prescribing it because of dangerous interactions with common drugs that treat cholesterol, blood clots and other conditions. It must be taken within five days of the first symptoms. It leaves a foul taste in the mouth. In one study, 1 in 5 patients reported ""rebound"" COVID-19 symptoms a few days after finishing the medicine — though rebound can also occur without Paxlovid. A recent JAMA Network study found that sick people 85 and older were less likely than younger Medicare patients to get COVID-19 therapies such as Paxlovid. The drug might have prevented up to 27,000 deaths in 2022 if it had been allocated based on which patients were at highest risk from COVID-19. Nursing home patients, who account for around 1 in 6 U.S. COVID-19 deaths, were about two-thirds as likely as other older adults to get the drug. Shrunken confidence in government health programs is one reason the drug isn’t reaching those who need it. In senior living facilities, ""a lack of clear information and misinformation"" are ""causing residents and their families to be reluctant to take the necessary steps to reduce COVID risks,"" said David Gifford, chief medical officer for an association representing 14,000 health care providers, many in senior care. The anti-vaxxers spreading falsehoods about vaccines have targeted Paxlovid as well. Some call themselves anti-paxxers. ""Proactive and health-literate people get the drug. Those who are receiving information more passively have no idea whether it’s important or harmful,"" said Michael Barnett, a primary care physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard, who led the JAMA Network study. In fact, the drug is still free for those who are uninsured or enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal health programs, including those for veterans. That’s what rescued Hyatt, whose Department of Veterans Affairs health plan doesn’t normally cover outpatient drugs. While he searched on his phone for a solution, the pharmacist’s assistant suddenly appeared from the store. ""It won’t cost you anything!"" she said. As Hyatt’s case suggests, it helps to know to ask for free Paxlovid, although federal officials say they’ve educated clinicians and pharmacists — like the one who helped Hyatt — about the program. ""There is still a heaven!"" Hyatt replied. After he had been on Paxlovid for a few days his symptoms were gone and his surgery was rescheduled. Pfizer sold the U.S. government 23.7 million five-day courses of Paxlovid, produced under an FDA emergency authorization, in 2021 and 2022, at a price of around $530 each. Under the new agreement, Pfizer commits to provide the drug for the beneficiaries of the government insurance programs. Meanwhile, Pfizer bills insurers for some portion of the $1,390 list price. Some patients say pharmacies have quoted them prices of $1,600 or more. How exactly Pfizer arrived at that price isn’t clear. Pfizer won’t say. A Harvard University study last year estimated the cost of producing generic Paxlovid at about $15 per treatment course, including manufacturing expenses, a 10% profit markup, and 27% in taxes. Pfizer reported $12.5 billion in Paxlovid and COVID-19 vaccine sales in 2023, after a $57 billion peak in 2022. The company’s 2024 Super Bowl ad, which cost an estimated $14 million to place, focused on Pfizer’s cancer drug pipeline, newly reinforced with its $43 billion purchase of biotech company Seagen. Unlike some other recent oft-aired Pfizer ads (""If it’s COVID, Paxlovid""), it didn’t mention COVID-19 products. The other problem is getting the drug where it is needed. ""We negotiated really hard with Pfizer to make sure that Paxlovid would be available to Americans the way they were accustomed to,"" Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told reporters in February. ""If you have private insurance, it should not cost you much money, certainly not more than $100."" Yet in nursing homes, getting Paxlovid is particularly cumbersome, said Chad Worz, CEO of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists, specialists who provide medicines to care homes. If someone in long-term care tests positive for COVID-19, the nurse tells the physician, who orders the drug from a pharmacist, who may report back that the patient is on several drugs that interact with Paxlovid, Worz said. Figuring out which drugs to stop temporarily requires further consultations while the time for efficacious use of Paxlovid dwindles, he said. His group tried to get the FDA to approve a shortcut similar to the standing orders that enable pharmacists to deliver anti-influenza medications when there are flu outbreaks in nursing homes, Worz said.""We were close,"" he said, but ""it just never came to fruition."" ""The FDA is unable to comment,"" spokesperson Chanapa Tantibanchachai said. Los Angeles County requires nursing homes to offer any COVID-positive patient an antiviral, but the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees nursing homes nationwide, has not issued similar guidance. ""And this is a mistake,"" said Karl Steinberg, chief medical officer for two nursing home chains with facilities in San Diego County, which also has no such mandate. A requirement would ensure the patient ""isn’t going to fall through the cracks,"" he said. Although it hasn’t ordered doctors to prescribe Paxlovid, CMS on Jan. 4 issued detailed instructions to health insurers urging swift approval of Paxlovid prescriptions, given the five-day window for the drug’s efficacy. It also ""encourages"" plans to make sure pharmacists know about the free Paxlovid arrangement. Current COVID-19 strains appear less virulent than those that circulated earlier in the pandemic, and years of vaccination and COVID-19 infection have left fewer people at risk of grave outcomes. But risk remains, particularly among older seniors, who account for most COVID-19 deaths, which number more than 13,500 so far this year in the U.S. Steinberg, who sees patients in 15 residences, said he orders Paxlovid even for COVID-19-positive patients without symptoms. None of the 30 to 40 patients whom he prescribed the drug in the past year needed hospitalization, he said; two stopped taking it because of nausea or the foul taste, a pertinent concern in older people whose appetites already have ebbed. Steinberg said he knew of two patients who died of COVID-19 in his companies’ facilities this year. Neither was on Paxlovid. He can’t be sure the drug would have made a difference, but he’s not taking any chances. The benefits, he said, outweigh the risks.

Verificando el discurso de Joe Biden sobre el Estado de la Unión en 2024,"March 8, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"Immigration, National, Border Security, Economy, Health Care, Crime","Joe Biden utilizó su discurso sobre el Estado de la Unión en 2024 para adoptar una postura de lucha. Biden no dijo el nombre del expresidente Donald Trump en sus comentarios, pero invocó con frecuencia el historial y las propuestas de Trump, refiriéndose a él normalmente como ""mi predecesor."" Algunos republicanos criticaron a Biden desde que entró a la sala. La representante Marjorie Taylor Greene, republicana de Georgia, cuestionó a Biden por el asesinato de la estudiante de enfermería de la Universidad de Georgia Laken Riley. Un inmigrante ilegalmente en el país es acusado de la muerte de Riley. Biden se presentó como protector y defensor de los estadounidenses y su prosperidad, promoviendo políticas para aliviar los préstamos estudiantiles y reducir los precios de los medicamentos recetados. Biden reiteró su llamado a los congresistas republicanos para que aprueben la ayuda a Ucrania, que está luchando contra una invasión rusa. También pidió a Hamás que liberase a los rehenes israelíes en Gaza, a la vez que anunció un plan para construir un embarcadero temporal para ampliar la ayuda humanitaria a los palestinos atrapados en el fuego cruzado. Hemos comprobado declaraciones clave sobre inmigración, economía, crimen y derechos reproductivos. Dialogo sobre Laken Riley y el inmigrante acusado de su asesinato Durante años, los republicanos han culpado a Biden de la inmigración ilegal, históricamente alta bajo su mandato. Algunos republicanos llevaban pins rojos y blancos que decían ""Alto a la crisis fronteriza de Biden"". Cuando Biden entró en la Cámara de Representantes, Greene le entregó un pin con un texto que decía: ""Di su nombre: Laken Riley"", la estudiante de la Universidad de Georgia asesinada. Mientras hablaba de seguridad fronteriza e inmigración, Greene interrumpió a Biden y le retó a decir el nombre de Riley. ""Lincoln Riley, una joven inocente que fue asesinada por un ilegal"", dijo Biden, pronunciando mal el nombre de Riley. Algunos demócratas de alto nivel le criticaron por utilizar la expresión ""ilegal"", argumentando que es deshumanizadora. ""Debería haber dicho indocumentados"", dijo en CNN la ex presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, la demócrata Nancy Pelosi de California. ""Permítanme ser clara: ningún ser humano es ilegal"", publicó en X la representante Ilhan Omar, demócrata de Minnesota. Durante la respuesta republicana al discurso de Biden, Katie Britt, senadora de Alabama, dijo que el presidente ""optó por liberar"" a EE.UU. al hombre acusado de matar a Riley. ""Fue brutalmente asesinada por uno de los millones de inmigrantes ilegales que el presidente Biden decidió liberar en nuestra patria"", dijo Britt. José Ibarra, el hombre acusado del asesinato de Riley, cruzó ilegalmente la frontera entre Estados Unidos y México en septiembre de 2022. Ibarra fue puesto en libertad condicional, lo que le permite ser liberado en los EE.UU. a la espera de nuevos procedimientos de inmigración, de acuerdo con el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, por sus siglas en inglés). Biden no decide quién entra en el país. Los funcionarios de fronteras deciden a quién dejan en libertad porque carecen de recursos suficientes para detener a todas las personas que cruzan ilegalmente las fronteras estadounidenses. ""La inflación ha bajado del 9% al 3%, ¡la más baja del mundo!"". EE.UU. tiene una inflación más baja que la mayoría de los países industrializados avanzados, pero no ocupa el primer puesto a nivel internacional. Biden tiene razón en que la inflación ha bajado del 9% en el verano de 2022 a poco más del 3% en la actualidad, en medio de fuertes subidas de los tipos de interés por parte de la Reserva Federal. En diciembre de 2023, siete países de la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico  — Canadá, Dinamarca, Italia, Letonia, Lituania, Países Bajos y Corea del Sur — tenían tasas de inflación inferiores a la de Estados Unidos. Veinte países miembros de la OCDE tenían tasas de inflación superiores a las de EE.UU., entre ellos Francia, Alemania y el Reino Unido, que pertenecen al G-7 de economías de élite. ""América es más segura hoy que cuando asumí el cargo "", dijo Biden, afirmando que el año antes de convertirse en presidente, ""los asesinatos subieron un 30%"", ""el incremento más grande en la historia"". El crimen violento ha disminuido recientemente en los Estados Unidos, y Biden se atribuyó la responsabilidad. Es verdad que los homicidios incrementaron un 30% en 2020, y fue considerado el incremento anual más significativo en más de una década. Pero Biden ignoró que el aumento coincidió con la pandemia de COVID-19. Promocionando su Acta del Plan de Rescate Americano de 2022 como ""la mayor inversión en seguridad pública jamás realizada"", Biden señaló la tasa de homicidios de 2023. ""El año pasado, la tasa de asesinatos vio la disminución más pronunciada en la historia. Los crímenes violentos cayeron a uno de los niveles más bajos en más de 50 años. Pero tenemos más por hacer"". Los crímenes violentos han disminuido desde los récords de 2020, pero esto es por varios factores, dicen expertos, algunos que están fuera del control de Biden. Usando datos de cientos de ciudades, criminalistas estimaron que los homicidios en 2023 disminuyeron alrededor de un 12% comparado con 2022. Los números son considerados preliminares, pero los analistas de crimen dicen que si los números finales se mantienen igual, esto representaría una de las mayores disminuciones de homicidios en un solo año desde que se comenzaron a llevar registros de delitos en Estados Unidos. A pesar de la disminución, los datos muestran que se espera que la tasa de homicidios de 2023 sea aproximadamente un 18% más alta que en 2019, antes de que la pandemia comenzará. La implementación de algunas legislaciones pudo haber ayudado a hacer que la tendencia disminuyera, dijeron investigadores. Estas son el Acta del Plan de Rescate, que incluía financiación para iniciativas comunitarias de seguridad pública, y la Ley Bipartidista de Comunidades más Seguras de 2022, que financió ayuda a estados para reducir el uso de armas de fuego. Otros factores contribuyentes probablemente incluyen un alivio de las disrupciones sociales por la pandemia y los esfuerzos individuales de las ciudades en respuesta a los aumentos en homicidios. ""La Corte Suprema de Alabama cerró los tratamientos de fecundación in vitro en todo el estado, a raíz de una decisión de la Corte Suprema que anuló Roe vs. Wade"". El 16 de febrero, la Corte Suprema de Alabama dijo que los embriones congelados deben considerarse niños. La decisión no tiene el poder de terminar los tratamientos de fecundación in vitro (FIV) en todo el estado. Pero provocó que varias clínicas suspendieran los tratamientos de FIV mientras analizaban la decisión y las posibles responsabilidades. Desde entonces, los legisladores de Alabama han aprobado leyes para proteger a los proveedores de FIV de la responsabilidad civil o penal, en un intento de proteger los tratamientos de fertilidad tras la creciente reacción. Dos clínicas anunciaron que reanudaban sus operaciones después de que la gobernadora republicana Kay Ivey firmara la ley. La senadora demócrata Tammy Duckworth de Illinois, quien tuvo dos hijas fecundadas in vitro, presentó un proyecto de ley federal similar para proteger la fecundación in vitro.

Fact-checking Katie Britt's immigration claims in Republican 2024 State of the Union response,"March 8, 2024",Marta Campabadal Graus,"Immigration, Border Security","Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., delivered the Republican response to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address from her kitchen table in Montgomery, Alabama. During her 17-minute rebuttal, Britt criticized Biden on immigration, the economy and crime. ""What we saw was the performance of a permanent politician who has actually been in office for longer than I've been alive,"" said Britt, who is 42. ""Our families are hurting. Our country can do better. And you don't have to look any further than the crisis at our southern border to see it,"" Britt said. ""President Biden inherited the most secure border of all time. But minutes after taking office, he suspended all deportations, he halted construction of the border wall and he announced a plan to give amnesty to millions."" ""We know that President Biden didn't just create this border crisis,"" Britt continued. ""He invited it with 94 executive actions in his first 100 days."" It’s unclear which specific 94 executive actions Britt was referring to. A few months into Biden’s administration, the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute released a report detailing 94 immigration-related Biden executive actions. However, not all the actions were directly related to the border. Here’s the context behind Britt’s claims. On Biden’s first day in office, the Department of Homeland Security published a memo pausing the removals of certain people illegally in the U.S. for 100 days. Federal courts quickly stopped the pause. The memo also acknowledged that because of resource constraints, and increased illegal border crossings, removals should be prioritized for people who posed a national security or public safety threat or who entered the U.S. after Nov. 1, 2020. ""While resources should be allocated to the priorities enumerated above, nothing in this memorandum prohibits the apprehension or detention of individuals unlawfully in the United States who are not identified as priorities herein,"" the memo added. In September 2021, DHS released a second memo detailing similar guidelines for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prioritize the removal of people who have crossed the border in recent years or who threaten public safety. Courts also halted those guidelines in 2021, but they were reinstated in 2023 after a Supreme Court decision. There have been more than 3.6 million removals, returns and expulsions from February 2021, Biden’s first month in office, to September 2023, based on Department of Homeland Security estimates. On his first day in office, Biden issued a proclamation terminating the national emergency, former President Donald Trump used to divert Defense Department funding to build additional border barriers. However, in October 2023, the Biden administration resumed barrier construction using money Congress had previously appropriated. The administration also has spent millions on barrier repairs. Immigration experts have questioned barriers’ effectiveness at reducing illegal immigration. Instead of lowering the number of people crossing, barriers have prompted people mainly to try crossing at different parts of the border, David Bier, immigration studies director at the libertarian Cato Institute told PolitiFact in July 2023. ""Amnesty"" is a political term that can be defined narrowly as giving people in the U.S. illegally citizenship or broadly to mean any policy favorable to people in the U.S. illegally. On his first day in office, Biden proposed the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 to provide a citizenship path for farmworkers and immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children and for beneficiaries of Temporary Protected Status. House Democrats introduced the bill in February 2021, but it did not advance. More recently, Biden said he would sign the Senate’s bipartisan immigration bill into law if it reached his desk. That bill, which failed a vote in the Senate, did not include a path to citizenship for people living in the U.S. illegally. Britt also mentioned the killing of 22-year old University of Georgia nursing student, Laken Riley. ""This beautiful 22-year-old nursing student went out on a jog one morning, but she never got the opportunity to return home,"" Britt said. ""She was brutally murdered by one of the millions of illegal border crossers President Biden chose to release into our homeland."" Jose Ibarra, the man charged with Riley’s killing, illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in September 2022. Ibarra was paroled in, allowing him to be released into the U.S. to await further immigration proceedings, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Biden does not decide who is released into the country. Border officials decide whom to release into the U.S. because they lack enough resources to detain everyone who illegally crosses U.S. borders.

"Fact-checking Joe Biden on inflation, the deficit and consumer confidence in the State of the Union","March 8, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"Economy, Jobs","As president, Joe Biden saw the economy endure 40-year-high levels of inflation. But during his 2024 State of the Union address, he took a victory lap on the reduced inflation rate, job creation and other economic metrics. ""I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our nation’s history,"" Biden said. ""And we have. It doesn’t make the news, but in thousands of cities and towns the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told."" We have found many of the claims he repeated to be accurate or close. Biden said the U.S. has seen ""15 million new jobs in just three years."" (Rounded, he’s correct; it’s about 14.8 million.) He said unemployment is ""at 50-year lows."" (It was at 50-year lows in 2023 but has climbed marginally since then.) He said there are ""800,000 new manufacturing jobs in America and counting."" (We rated a similar Biden statement Mostly True.) He said, ""The racial wealth gap is the smallest it’s been in 20 years."" (This is accurate by one measure but not by another.) And he said, ""Wages keep going up and inflation keeps coming down."" (Wages adjusted for inflation are on track to return to where they were when Biden was inaugurated within a few months; for the past year-plus, wages have outpaced inflation.) Three statements about inflation, consumer confidence and the deficit needed more context. The U.S. has lower inflation than most advanced industrialized nations, but it does not rank No. 1 internationally. Biden is correct that year-over-year inflation has dropped from 9% in summer 2022 to a little above 3% today amid sharp interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. In December 2023, seven countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  — Canada, Denmark, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands and South Korea — had inflation rates lower than that of the U.S. Twenty OECD member countries had higher inflation rates than the U.S., including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, each of which belongs to the G-7 of elite economies. It depends on the measure. Two long-running consumer confidence measures are released by the University of Michigan and the Conference Board, a business membership and research organization. Consumer confidence, as measured by the University of Michigan survey, has climbed sharply since bottoming out in summer 2022, when inflation reached 9%, a four-decade high. However, the rating under Biden remains lower than it was for four of the past five presidents at the same point in their tenures. And for more than two years through December 2023, the survey’s consumer sentiment score was lower than it was in April 2020 — a startling finding, given that in April 2020 the unemployment rate was 13.2% and Americans were facing the uncertainty of a once-a-century pandemic. Biden scores higher on the Conference Board survey, which has more questions based on the labor market than on inflation. The labor market has been an economic strength on Biden watch. And the Conference Board survey shows consumer sentiment is now higher than it was under three of the previous four presidents at this point in their tenures. Other surveys show a continuing sour public sentiment about the economy. For instance, a February Marquette Law School poll found that 35% of national respondents said the economy was ""excellent"" or ""good,"" compared with 65% who said it was ""not so good"" or ""poor."" This merits asterisks. The deficit — the difference between federal spending and federal revenues — fell by $1.4 trillion between 2021, Biden’s first year in office, and 2022, his second year. That was a larger decline than any in any previous one-year span. However, this reduction stems largely from the phasing out of pandemic era relief programs. Also, even at its reduced levels, the deficit remains higher under Biden than it was pre-pandemic. The deficit in 2022 and 2023 under Biden was higher than in each of Trump’s first three years, partly because of bills such as the 2021 American Rescue Plan, a pandemic recovery measure. In addition, the cumulative debt has continued to climb even though the deficit has narrowed."
"Yes, George Santos can attend the State of the Union, walk House floor despite being expelled","March 8, 2024",Louis Jacobson,Congress,"Surprise guests are a feature of the president's State of the Union address. President Joe Biden’s March 7 speech had a big one, though not one invited by the president: former Rep. George Santos, who was seen mingling with his former Republican colleagues a little more than three months after the House expelled him. This surprised some people. Is Santos really allowed to sit among the people who expelled him in December? The short answer is yes, according to the Rules of the House of Representatives. ""Surprisingly to me, there is no bar in the rules, regulations, or precedents barring a former member from the floor generally, unless they are a lobbyist or someone advocating for  particular individuals, groups or causes,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, a congressional scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Another reason former members would be barred is if they have been convicted of a crime related to House activities. That doesn’t affect Santos — yet. Santos faces criminal charges including wire fraud, false statements, identity theft and conspiracy, but his case has not gone to trial yet. As Biden was getting into his limousine to be driven to the Capitol, CNN reported that Santos was initially seated in a section usually filled by current members. Chamber officials asked Santos to stand in the back of the chamber, and he complied, CNN reported. Beyond floor access, Santos is allowed, as a former House member, to use parking, athletic and wellness facilities, administrative services, dining facilities, and access materials from the Congressional Research Service and the Library of Congress. Former members may also use the frank — the right to send mail to constituents free of charge — for 90 days after leaving office. For Santos, who was expelled Dec. 1, 2023, that deadline has passed. Wolfensberger added that the House speaker does have some discretion to direct the chamber’s sergeant-at-arms to bar people, including former members, from accessing the floor. ""In this case, the distraction factor alone would justify such an action to preserve and protect the dignity and decorum of the chamber,"" Wolfensberger said."
Fact-checking Joe Biden’s 2024 State of the Union address,"March 8, 2024",Louis Jacobson,National,"Facing a challenging path to reelection amid low favorability ratings and public wariness over the economy, President Joe Biden used his 2024 State of the Union address to take a fighting posture. He repeatedly drew contrasts with his presumptive Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, and occasionally sparred with GOP lawmakers in the audience. ""This is a moment to speak the truth, to bury lies,"" Biden said, referring to the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol  by Trump supporters who believed falsehoods that the 2020 election had been stolen. ""Here's the simple truth: You can't love your country only when you win."" Biden didn’t say Trump’s name in his remarks, but he frequently invoked Trump’s record and  proposals, usually referring to him as ""my predecessor."" Some Republicans called out Biden from the floor. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., challenged Biden over the killing of University of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. An immigrant in the country illegally has been charged in Riley’s death. Another Republican lawmaker, Wisconsin Rep. Derrick Van Orden, yelled, ""Lies!"" in response to Biden’s criticism of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., gave the Republicans’ response to the speech and we fact-checked that. In forceful terms, Biden framed himself as a protector and defender of Americans and their prosperity, touting pocketbook policies to ease student loan burdens and lower prescription drug prices. Biden repeated calls for Republicans in Congress to approve aid to Ukraine, which is fighting an invasion by Russia. He also walked a fine line on the Middle East. He called for Hamas to free the Israeli hostages it continues to hold in Gaza — the families of some hostages were in the chamber for his address — but also announced a plan to build a temporary pier to expand humanitarian aid to Palestinians caught in the crossfire. We fact-checked key statements on immigration, Trump, the economy, reproductive rights and crime. Biden blamed Republicans for sidelining Senate border security bill For years, Republicans have blamed Biden for the historically high illegal immigration under his watch. Some Republicans wore red and white pins that said ""Stop the Biden border crisis"" in large capital letters. As Biden entered the House chamber, Greene gave him a pin with text that said: ""Say her name: Laken Riley,"" the University of Georgia student who was murdered. As he discussed border security and immigration, Greene interrupted Biden and challenged him to say Riley’s name. ""Lincoln Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal,"" Biden said, misstating Riley’s first name. Some high-profile Democrats criticized him for using the phrase ""illegal,"" which some argue is dehumanizing. ""He should have said undocumented,"" former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on CNN. ""Let me be clear: No human being is illegal,"" Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., posted on X. Biden also said it was Republicans’ turn to act and cooperate with him and Democrats on a border security bill. He blamed Republicans for sidelining a Senate immigration bill, which failed in a 49-50 vote, that he claimed was ""the toughest set of border security reforms we’ve ever seen."" Here’s some context missing from some of Biden’s comments on the bill. ""It would also give me and any new president new emergency authority to temporarily shut down the border when the number of migrants at the border is overwhelming."" This needs context. The proposal sought to enable the executive branch to block people from seeking asylum in between ports of entry if illegal immigration encounters reached certain levels. It aimed to change what happened when people reached the border, but that doesn’t mean people would stop showing up. Despite the emergency authority, the government’s ability to quickly remove people from the U.S. would still hinge on its resources, and other countries’ willingness to take back immigrants. ""In short, there is no authority that Congress could pass that would allow for a ‘complete and total shutdown of the border,’"" Theresa Cardinal Brown, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s senior adviser for Immigration and border policy previously told PolitiFact. ""That's just not how borders work in any real sense. Especially not our border with Mexico."" ""That bill would hire … 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backload of 2 million cases."" The backlog number is higher — there are more than 3 million cases in immigration courts as of November 2023, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. The backlog grew by 1 million cases from November 2022 to November 2023. The bill called for ""4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in six months instead of six years now."" On average, asylum cases in immigration court take more than four years to be resolved, according to a 2023 report published by the American Immigration Council, an immigrants’ rights advocacy group. But the growing case backlog could increase that average. In more than a dozen nameless references to his predecessor, Biden used partial quotes by Trump to draw policy contrasts on guns; Roe v. Wade; and Russian President Vladimir Putin and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. ""Now my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin, quote, ‘do whatever the hell you want.’ That’s a quote."" Trump wasn’t directly inviting Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO allies. He was telling a story during a rally in South Carolina about what he said to an unnamed ally years ago. Trump claimed  he was tough on NATO and got results, misrepresenting several facts about the alliance and his record in the process. ""I got them to pay up,"" Trump said Feb. 10. ""NATO was busted until I came along. I said, ’Everybody’s gonna pay.’ They said, ‘Well, if we don’t pay, are you still going to protect us?’ I said, ‘Absolutely not.’"" Trump added, ""One of the presidents of a big country stood up and said, ‘Well, sir, if we don’t pay and we are attacked by Russia, will you protect us?’ I said, ‘You didn't pay, you are delinquent?"" He said, ‘Yes, let’s say that happened.’ No, I would not protect you, in fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they wanted. You gotta pay. You gotta pay your bills."" President Joe Biden delivers the State of the Union before a join session of Congress on March 7, 2024, at the U.S. Capitol. (AP) ""My predecessor told the NRA he’s proud he did nothing on guns when he was president."" Trump did say that, even though his record was more nuanced. Speaking at the National Rifle Association’s convention in Pennsylvania in February, Trump said, ""During my four years, nothing happened. And there was great pressure on me, having to do with guns. We did nothing. We didn’t yield."" But in 2019, when Trump was asked what he had done about the gun problem, he said, ""We’ve done, actually, a lot."" Trump banned bump stocks, which let semi-automatic weapons fire dozens of bullets in seconds. He also supported a bipartisan effort to improve the background-check database and his administration prioritized gun-related prosecutions. However, Trump’s administration also tried to expand gun laws and regulations or block efforts to tighten them. ""After another shooting in Iowa recently … when asked what to do about it he said,  ‘Just get over it.’"" Trump’s remarks were not in direct response to a question. Trump’s full remarks, which included sympathies for the victims, came at a January rally in Iowa after a sixth grade student was killed and several others wounded in a shooting at Perry High School. The shooter, 17, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot. ""I want to send our support and our deepest sympathies to the victims and families touched by the terrible school shooting yesterday in Perry, Iowa."" Trump also said, ""It’s just horrible, so surprising to see it here. But, ah, have to get over it, we have to move forward, we have to move forward. But to the relatives and to all of the people that are so devastated right now to a point they can’t breathe, they can’t live, we are with you all the way, we are with you and we love you and we cherish you."" ""My predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it's overturned and he brags about it."" At a January town hall in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump said, ""For 54 years, they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated. And I did it and I’m proud to have done it."" Trump also said, ""Nobody else was going to get that done but me and we did it, and we did something that was a miracle."" Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices that cemented the court’s conservative majority, which reversed the Roe decision in June 2022. On Truth Social in May 2023, Trump said, ""After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade, much to the ‘shock’ of everyone."" Biden took a victory lap on the reduced inflation rate and other economic metrics. But a few of his talking points, including on ""soaring"" consumer confidence and cuts to the deficit, were exaggerated. ""Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3% — the lowest in the world!"" The U.S. is doing better on managing inflation than most advanced industrialized nations are, but does not rank No. 1 internationally. Biden is correct that the year-over-year inflation rate has dropped from 9%, a four-decade high,  in summer of 2022 to a little above 3% today amid sharp interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. In December 2023, seven countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  — Canada, Denmark, Italy, Latvia,Lithuania, the Netherlands and South Korea — had inflation rates lower than the U.S’. Twenty OECD member countries had higher inflation rates than the U.S., including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, each of which belongs to the G-7 of elite economies. ""Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring."" It depends on the measure. Two long-running consumer confidence measures are released by the University of Michigan and the Conference Board, a business membership and research organization. Consumer confidence, as measured by the University of Michigan survey,, has climbed sharply since bottoming out in the summer of 2022, when inflation reached 9%, a four-decade high. However, the rating under Biden remains lower than it was for four of the past five presidents at the same point in their tenures. Biden scores higher on the Conference Board survey, which is focused more on questions related to the labor market than inflation. The labor market has been a strength for Biden during his watch. And the Conference Board survey shows that consumer sentiment is now higher than it was under three of the previous four presidents at this point in their tenures. ""I’ve already cut the federal deficit by over a trillion dollars."" This merits asterisks. The deficit — the difference between federal spending and federal revenues — fell by $1.4 trillion between 2021, Biden’s first year in office, and 2022, his second year. That was a larger decline than any in any previous one-year span. However, this reduction stems largely from the phasing-out of pandemic era relief programs. Also, even at its reduced levels, the deficit remains higher under Biden than it was pre-pandemic. The deficit in 2022 and 2023 under Biden was higher than in each of Trump’s first three years, partly because of bills such as the 2021 American Rescue Plan, a pandemic recovery measure. Biden: ""There are 1,000 billionaires in America. You know what the average federal tax is for those billionaires? No? They’re making great sacrifices. 8.2%."" This is misleading. A White House report arrived at the 8.2% figure by including unrealized gains in the income calculations of the 400 richest U.S. families. Currently, if people see their stock shares rise in value over time, those gains are not taxed until the shares are sold. If the shares are never sold, they aren’t taxed. Under current law — which Biden proposes to change — stocks may be passed to the next generation with little or no taxation. Economists and policymakers have long debated whether the government should tax unrealized gains. But Biden made it sound as if 8.2% was the standard tax rate billionaires pay today. It’s not: Unrealized wealth, unlike income, is not taxed today. The actual average tax rate the top 1% of taxpayers pay is more than three times what Biden said: 25.6%, according to IRS data from 2019. A more elite group, the top 0.001% — which in 2019 meant people earning about $60 million or more a year — paid 22.9%. Another analysis, by the investigative journalism outlet ProPublica, found that the actual tax rate paid by 25 U.S. billionaires under current law is 16%, which is still about twice what Biden said. Violent crime has declined recently in the U.S., and Biden largely took responsibility.

""America is safer today than when I took office,"" he said, claiming that the year before he became president, ""murders went up 30%, the biggest increase in history."" Homicides did increase 30% in 2020, and it was considered the largest single-year jump in more than a century. But Biden ignored that the spike coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. Touting his 2022 American Rescue Plan Act as ""the largest investment in public safety ever,"" Biden pointed to the 2023 homicide rate: ""Last year, the murder rate saw the sharpest decrease in history. Violent crime fell to one of its lowest levels in more than 50 years. But we have more to do."" Violent crime has decreased from 2020’s record highs, but this is because of a confluence of factors, experts said, some that are beyond Biden’s control. Using data from hundreds of cities, criminologists estimated that 2023 homicides were down around 12% compared with 2022. The numbers are considered preliminary, but crime analysts say that if the final numbers remain the same, it would represent one of the largest single-year homicide declines since U.S. crime record-keeping began. Despite the decline, data shows that the 2023 homicide rate is expected to be about 18% higher than it was in 2019, before the pandemic began. Legislation such as the American Rescue Plan, which included funding for community public safety initiatives, and the 2022 Bipartisan Safer in Communities Act, which provided funding to help states implement ""red flag laws"" and put more limits on gun purchases, might have helped propel the downward trend, researchers said. Other contributing factors likely include an easing of the pandemic’s social disruptions and cities’ individual crime-reduction efforts in response to homicide spikes. ""The Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the state, unleashed by a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade."" On Feb. 16, the Alabama Supreme Court released a ruling that said frozen embryos should be considered children. The decision lacks the power to shut down in vitro fertilization treatments statewide. But it caused multiple clinics in the state to pause IVF treatments as they reviewed the decision and potential liabilities. Since then, Alabama lawmakers passed legislation to shield IVF providers from civil or criminal liability in a rush to protect fertility treatments after backlash grew. Two clinics announced they were resuming operations after Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed the law. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill. — who had two daughters using in vitro fertilization — introduced a similar federal bill aimed at protecting IVF. But Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., blocked it Feb. 28, saying it was a ""vast overreach that is full of poison pills that go way too far — far beyond ensuring legal access to IVF."" ""If you, the American people. send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you: I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again."" We continue to rate Biden's promise to codify Roe v. Wade Stalled. Biden called on Congress to help him achieve his 2020 campaign promise to codify Roe v Wade. He can’t do it alone. The Supreme Court ruled in 2022 to overturn Roe, ending nearly 50 years of federally protected abortion access. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., introduced the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2023, which would prohibit governmental restrictions on access to abortion. But it has no Republican co-sponsors and didn’t advance. We have been tracking Biden's campaign promise to codify Roe v. Wade, one of about 100 promises on our Biden Promise Tracker. The lack of 10 Republicans to overcome an expected filibuster has stalled Biden's efforts on codification. That lack of a path forward continued even after Democrats kept narrow control of the Senate in the midterms. Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world."" We rated a similar claim by Biden Mostly True. American per capita spending on prescription drugs is nearly three times the average of other advanced, industrialized countries that comprise the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. A study by the Rand Corp., a nonpartisan research organization, found that, across all drugs, U.S. prices were 2.78 times higher than the prices in 33 OECD countries. The gap was even larger for brand-name drugs, with U.S. prices averaging 4.22 times higher than those in comparison nations. The U.S. pays less than comparable nations for unbranded, generic drugs, which account for about 90% of filled prescriptions in the U.S., yet make up only one-fifth of prescription drug spending. Researchers say factors including country-specific pricing, confidential rebates and other discounts can obscure actual prices, making comparisons harder. Is former Rep. George Santos really allowed to sit among the people who expelled him in December? The short answer is yes.

Spotlight on 6 of Joe Biden’s campaign promises as he gives the 2024 State of the Union,"March 7, 2024",Matthew Crowley,"Immigration, Economy, Education, Marijuana","PolitiFact is tracking the status of 99 promises Joe Biden made as he campaigned for president in 2020. Our team researches and rates the status of each promise on a spectrum of progress. By our measure, the majority of his promises — 63% — are Stalled or In the Works; 27% were Kept, 6% were Compromises and 2% were Broken. Here's a closer look at the state of six of Biden’s promises. We’ll continue to update his progress in his fourth year. Following an incremental approach, Biden said his administration would cancel $1.2 billion more in debt for almost 153,000 borrowers. The forgiveness applies to people enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan. Biden launched this approach after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down his sweeping student loan forgiveness plan, which would have eliminated about $400 billion in student loans. Through executive actions, Biden has OK’d about $138 billion in student debt cancellation for almost 3.9 million borrowers. Under SAVE, borrowers who make monthly payments won’t have to pay interest on their loans. About 7.5 million people are enrolled in the plan, officials said; about 4.3 million of them have no monthly payment because of the plan’s expanded income exemption. The Education Department said Biden’s administration has approved: $56.7 billion for about 793,000 borrowers through changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. $45.6 billion for 930,500 borrowers through improvements to income-driven repayment. $11.7 billion for 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. $22.5 billion for 1.3 million borrowers through closed school discharges, borrower defense, and related court settlements. We will assess how close Biden came to eliminating debt for undergraduate borrowers earning up to $125,000 as the end of his term nears. For now, this promise remains In the Works. Ryan Pontillo attaches an LG battery to a 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EV on June 15, 2023, at the General Motors Orion Assembly plant in Lake Orion, Michigan. (AP) The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines automotive industry jobs in four categories. Each has grown under Biden. Motor vehicles and parts manufacturing grew from almost 945,600 jobs when Biden was inaugurated to 1,064,100 in January 2024, the most recent month with available data. Wholesale motor vehicles and parts grew from 342,900 to 383,900 jobs over the same period. Retail motor vehicles and parts grew from about 1.9 million jobs to almost 2.1 million. Automotive repair and maintenance grew from 904,900 jobs to a bit more than 1 million. These four categories collectively added 424,700 jobs on Biden's watch. By this pace, more than 560,000 auto-sector jobs would be added in his presidential term’s remaining year. That works out to fewer than 1 million jobs over four years and omits some jobs beyond these categories, such as electric vehicle charging stations, which Biden cited in making the promise. The BlueGreen Alliance, which backs pro-environment policies including electric vehicles, estimated that 188,000 new electric-vehicle-related jobs have been created from already-announced projects. Adding all 188,000 jobs to Biden's total wouldn't get him to 1 million, and time is running out to reach his ambitious campaign goal. So far, we’ll rate this promise In the Works. On his first day in office, Biden proposed a bill to create a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. But the bill went nowhere. In February, a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a new immigration bill intended to reduce illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. Although Biden said he would sign it into law if it reached his desk, it failed in the Senate with a 49-50 vote. The measure didn’t include a path to citizenship for people living in the U.S. illegally, but sought to raise the initial asylum screening standard. The prospect of Biden signing a bill granting a pathway to citizenship seems unlikely in a Republican-controlled House. For now, we rate this promise Stalled. People listen to the California reparations task force as they vote on recommendations, May 6, 2023, during a meeting at Lesser Hall in Mills College at Northeastern University in Oakland, California. (AP) After winning the presidency, Biden said that ""the African American community stood up again for me. You've always had my back, and I'll have yours."" Although Biden kept his campaign promise to reduce the rate of uninsured African Americans and has worked toward his promise to make historically Black colleges and universities more affordable, he’s made scant progress toward the study of reparations. He did not promise to pay reparations — only to support its study. Since 1989, Democrats have introduced bills calling to study reparations for African Americans. These ideas gained more attention in 2020, after a white Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd, a Black man. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, reintroduced related legislation in January 2023, but it has not received a vote in the Republican-led House. For now, we’ll rate this Promise Broken. Biden's promise to decriminalize marijuana moved forward in 2023, but awaits the U.S. Justice Department's review. Federal law so far classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act; the classification is meant for the most dangerous substances, including heroin and LSD. In August 2023, the federal Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the Drug Enforcement Administration reschedule cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3, which would put marijuana on par with some doses of codeine, ketamine, and anabolic steroids. In January, Health and Human Services, in a 252-page recommendation, acknowledged cannabis as having an accepted medical use and relatively low potential for abuse. There is no mandated timeline for the federal government to act, and the Drug Enforcement Administration has historically taken years to do so, Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, a group advocating for descheduling marijuana, told PolitiFact. For now, this promise remains In the Works. Biden vowed to invest $18 billion in four-year historically Black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions. Biden hasn’t reached that level of investment, but experts say his administration has taken many steps toward fulfilling this promise. Biden’s administration has invested more than $7 billion in HBCUs, with $1.7 billion allocated for grants to support low-income students and make HBCUs more affordable. The largest sum, $2.7 billion, came from the 2021 American Rescue Plan, which Congress passed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also in 2021, Biden invested $1.6 billion in Capital Financing Debt Relief to discharge HBCUs’ debt. In 2023, the Education Department announced $93 million in new research and postsecondary grants for minority-serving colleges and universities. Despite a significant increase in funding, the Biden administration's improvements totaled less than half of the promised amount. So far, we rate this pledge Compromise.

"Why Gavin Newsom’s claim about 65,000 births from rape is not as conclusive as he made it sound","March 7, 2024",Samantha Putterman,"Abortion, National, Health Care, Women","Abortion rights advocate California Gov. Gavin Newsom has launched ads criticizing efforts in Republican-led states to stop women from traveling out of state for abortions. On CNN’s ""The Lead"" with Jake Tapper, the Democrat bashed the recent Alabama Supreme Court ruling that said frozen embryos should be considered children. Newsom then shared an eye-popping figure about rape-related births in states with abortion bans. ""You’ve seen the statistic: 65,000 births due to rapes since Dobbs in 14 states,"" Newsom told Tapper on Feb. 23, referring to the 2022 Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. ""Apparently, what the Republican party says, is that the rapist has more right to bring those babies to birth than families that are trying desperately to have the privilege that you and I have had as fathers and parents. It’s a disgrace."" In Dobbs, the Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that federally protected abortion access. Dobbs returned power to individual states to set their own laws. Newsom’s figure came from a January research letter from reproductive health researchers, including one expert from Planned Parenthood, which advocates for abortion access. The letter estimated about 64,565 pregnancies have been caused by rape in 14 states with total abortion bans since the Dobbs decision.

Nine of the states don’t have exceptions for rape or incest; most that do allow abortion only through the first weeks of pregnancy, and require the sexual assault to be reported to law enforcement first. The researchers said these were pregnancies — not necessarily births, as Newsom said. And the paper referred to a report that found that even states with rape exceptions recorded fewer than 10 abortions per month, increasing the likelihood that the mothers carried the pregnancies into term. The paper’s authors acknowledged that they don’t know from the data how many of these pregnancies ended in miscarriage or births. It’s also unclear how many rape-induced pregnancies were terminated in out-of-state abortions. Newsom’s office told PolitiFact that he was surmising that the number represented births because these states have total abortion bans. ""Those 65,000 people who become pregnant due to rape are no longer afforded the same legal reproductive rights they were prior to Trump & Republican-appointed Justices overturning Roe — forcing them to give birth to their rapists’ baby,"" Newsom spokesperson Brandon Richards wrote in an email. Rachel Perry, a board-certified OB-GYN at UCI Health in California, said that although the study’s pregnancy number is an estimate, its methodology is sound and draws from the best available data.

""At this time, there is no way to determine how many people in these states are able to access abortion in general, or specifically for rape-related pregnancy,"" she said. Here’s a closer look at the paper’s findings. The research letter was published by JAMA Network and authored by researchers from Planned Parenthood of Montana; Resound Research for Reproductive Health in Austin, Texas; Hunter College, City University of New York; Cambridge Health Alliance in Massachusetts; and the University of California, San Francisco. The authors used years-old data from federal sources to arrive at the post-Dobbs estimate of 64,565 pregnancies from July 1, 2022, to Jan. 1, 2024. Those data sources included the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey from 2016 to 2017 and 2019 FBI Uniform Crime Report data showing reported rapes by state. The CDC’s annual sexual violence telephone survey involved 15,152 women and 12,419 men ages 18 and older and included detailed responses to numerous questions about the nature of their experiences with sexual violence. Using that data, the letter’s authors estimated the national incidence of ""vaginal rape"" in combination with FBI data focused on states with total abortion bans: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. With these calculations, the authors determined that there were about 519,981 vaginal rapes among women ages 15 to 45 in those states and about 12.4% of these survivors had resulting pregnancies. That brought the number of estimated pregnancies in those states to 64,565. Of those pregnancies, the authors estimated that 9% occurred in states with abortion bans that have exceptions for rape, and 91% in states with no rape exceptions and that Texas had the highest rate of rape-related pregnancies, 26,313. Kari White, a report co-author and executive and scientific director of Resound Research for Reproductive Health in Austin, Texas, said researchers used the CDC survey data because rapes are ""vastly underreported.""

""It’s considered one of the most accurate sources of information on people’s experience of sexual violence, and is considered to be very good, though unlikely perfect, at capturing reported and unreported rapes,"" White said. ""A limitation is we are assuming any underreporting is consistent across places, but to drill down to the state level, we had to rely on a couple different data sources to make our estimate."" Using research from the Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit organization specializing in abortion and contraception science, the study’s authors found that 10 or fewer abortions occurred each month in states with exceptions for rape. This, the report said, suggests the exceptions ""fail to provide reasonable access to abortion for survivors."" Reproductive health experts we spoke with agreed that, because the paper relies on indirect estimations and several data sources, the assumptions can’t be fully validated. The possibility of miscarriage, which can occur in 10% to 15% of pregnancies, complicates determining how many rapes led to births, as does the uncertainty of how many rapes led to pregnancies. And some women may have traveled out of state for abortions. Alison Gemmill, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said there isn’t reliable data about who can access abortion in states that ban it. ""This study provides an estimate of rape-related pregnancies in banned states since Dobbs, but it’s not based on data that directly capture this information, let alone data collected post-Dobbs,"" said Gemmill. ""Instead, it uses multiple data sources and several assumptions to come up with an empirically-derived estimate. This is perhaps the best researchers can do because data that would enable a direct calculation of rape-related pregnancies do not exist."" Although some women may have traveled across state lines for abortions, the distances may hinder some of the most vulnerable rape survivors. Time magazine chronicled the story of a 13-year-old girl who gave birth after her mother said she was raped. She was denied an abortion in Mississippi, her home state, and the closest abortion provider was located more than a nine-hour drive away, in Chicago — a trip her family couldn’t afford. ""For many of the states we looked at, the people living in those states are facing travel distances of 300 to 800 miles to get to another place where abortion is legal and that is going to be a really difficult travel obstacle to overcome,"" White said. ""Particularly given what we know about people who are survivors of rape — many of them are in unsafe relationships or in dangerous family situations, making it even more difficult to travel."" It’s also worth noting that older research examining rates of rape-related pregnancies have calculated it differently. A 1996 study published by the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology put the national rate at 5% per rape among survivors ages 12 to 45. In 2018, a separate study found about 16% of all rape survivors experience pregnancy. Perry said that although the data is hard to accurately quantify, she doesn’t doubt the picture that the research letter paints. ""I think it’s reasonable to assume that most rape-related pregnancies in states with bans result in birth, given how difficult it is to access abortion for many individuals (the cost of travel is prohibitive, or the fear of legal risk is too high),"" she said. Gemill echoed that point: The data that does exist tells us rape related pregnancies occur in states that ban abortion, she said. ""We know from CDC data that over 2.5 million women in the U.S. reported experiencing sexual violence in the previous 12 months,"" Gemill said, ""so it seems feasible that some women living in banned states would experience rape-related pregnancy."""
¿Hay un aumento de migración de ‘hombres en edad militar’ de China?,"March 6, 2024",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"Immigration, Border Security, PolitiFact en Español","Tras el aumento del número de inmigrantes chinos cruzando la frontera sur de Estados Unidos, el congresista republicano de Florida Mario Díaz-Balart, el expresidente Donald Trump y otros republicanos han dicho que los que están llegando son ""hombres de edad militar"" y que esto es alarmante. ""Casi 9 millones de encuentros ilegales a nivel nacional bajo la crisis fronteriza de Biden"", dijo Díaz-Balart en una publicación en X el 4 de marzo. ""Entre los que aprovechan el caos se encuentran hombres de edad militar de China comunista, representando una amenaza para nuestra seguridad nacional"". Trump en una entrevista con Fox News en febrero dijo que están llegando hombres entre 18 y 25 años de edad y sugirió que su llegada es dirigida por el Partido Comunista de China. El presidente de la Cámara de Representantes, el republicano Mike Johnson de Luisiana, en un discurso en el hemiciclo describió a los inmigrantes como ""de edad militar"" y dijo que no representaban familias buscando refugio y asilo. Pero esto es engañoso. La Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza de Estados Unidos (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés) no publica datos específicos sobre la edad o el género de los inmigrantes que llegan a la frontera. También, la frase ""de edad militar"" significa diferentes cosas en diferentes países. No encontramos pruebas, como noticias o datos gubernamentales, que demuestren que los inmigrantes chinos llegan a Estados Unidos por orden del ejército chino. Los inmigrantes chinos llegan a Estados Unidos en busca de trabajo y libertad, las mismas fuerzas que impulsan a otros inmigrantes que vienen a Estados Unidos de otras partes del mundo. Abogados y activistas de inmigración nos dijeron que una parte significativa son hombres jóvenes, pero eso no es inusual en cualquier grupo de inmigrantes. A pesar del aumento del número de inmigrantes chinos en la frontera, estos siguen representando una pequeña parte de todos los encuentros fronterizos, según los datos de inmigración. Los inmigrantes de países latinoamericanos, como Venezuela y México, han protagonizado muchos más encuentros con las autoridades fronterizas. La afirmación falsa de que los inmigrantes chinos equivalen a una invasión ha circulado por redes sociales desde al menos el año pasado. Los encuentros con inmigrantes chinos en las fronteras de EE.UU. han aumentado de forma constante en los últimos tres años, pero se dispararon en el año fiscal 2023, el período de 12 meses que terminó en septiembre. Ese año, las autoridades fronterizas se encontraron con inmigrantes chinos más de 52,000 veces en las fronteras estadounidenses. En cada uno de los tres años anteriores, la cifra anual fue de menos de 30,000. En los cuatro primeros meses del año fiscal 2024, se han producido 29,800 encuentros con inmigrantes chinos, superando el total del año fiscal 2022. La mayoría de los inmigrantes chinos que llegan a la frontera sur son adultos que viajan solos, según los datos de CBP. Sin embargo, los datos no revelan la edad ni el género de las personas detenidas en la frontera. La agencia provee datos sobre las detenciones de adultos que llegan solos, familias con niños y niños que vienen solos. The Associated Press informó que los inmigrantes chinos vuelan a Ecuador como punto de partida de sus viajes a Estados Unidos porque Ecuador no exige visa. Gastan miles de dólares en el viaje y luego cruzan el Tapón de Darién, que conecta Colombia con Panamá. Xiaosheng Huang, abogado de inmigración en Las Vegas que representa mayormente a inmigrantes chinos, dijo que los inmigrantes que acuden a su bufete mayormente son varones de 25 a 40 años porque ""son lo bastante fuertes para afrontar los riesgos del camino"". Los jóvenes también son hábiles en el uso de redes sociales para encontrar información sobre cómo, cuándo y dónde cruzar la frontera sur de Estados Unidos. Chinese for Affirmative Action, un grupo con sede en California desde hace décadas que protege los derechos civiles y políticos de personas chino estadounidense, habló con unos 100 inmigrantes chinos en un reciente viaje a la frontera, dijo su portavoz Sin Yen Ling. Según la organización, el 81.3% de los migrantes con los que hablaron eran hombres, y la mayoría tenían entre 35 y 54 años. El personal también reportó haber hablado con chinos que emigraron con abuelos e hijos. Ling considera que la expresión ""hombres en edad militar"" es un alarmismo. ""Edad militar"" significa cosas diferentes en distintos países, con distintos requisitos para el servicio militar. En China, el servicio militar no es obligatorio. Los hombres chinos que cruzan la frontera carecen típicamente de formación militar formal, dijo Ling, en comparación a gente de países donde se exige el servicio militar. Abogados y defensores de la inmigración dicen que muchos factores han impulsado a chinos a emigrar a Estados Unidos. Ling apunta a la economía. La tasa de desempleo entre los jóvenes chinos de 16 a 24 años alcanzó el 21.3% en junio; después de eso, el gobierno dejó de publicar las cifras. Las recientes medidas del presidente de China Xi Jinping contra sectores como el tecnológico, el inmobiliario y el educativo, en los que los jóvenes han buscado tradicionalmente trabajo, han contribuido a la elevada tasa de desempleo, afirmó Ling. El producto interior bruto de China creció en 2023, pero ha venido mostrando signos de tensión. Las políticas estrictas y los cierres durante la pandemia de COVID-19 también impulsaron la emigración cuando China suavizó sus restricciones, lo que ocurrió más tarde que en la mayoría de otros países. La disminución de las vías legales para que los chinos emigren a EE.UU., las altas tasas de concesión de asilo a inmigrantes chinos y la imposibilidad de ser deportados de EE.UU. también contribuyen probablemente al aumento de la emigración china. El número de visas estadounidenses expedidas a ciudadanos chinos ha disminuido desde 2015, pero se desplomó durante la pandemia de COVID-19. El número de visas ha aumentado en los últimos años, pero aún no alcanza los niveles anteriores a la pandemia. Esto se debe en parte a las tensas relaciones diplomáticas entre Estados Unidos y China, y deja el cruce de la frontera sur en busca de asilo como una de las opciones más factibles para los migrantes chinos.  Según datos del Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse de la Universidad de Syracuse, los chinos tienen más éxito obteniendo asilo en Estados Unidos que los ciudadanos de otros países. Incluso cuando se les niega el asilo, el gobierno estadounidense no puede deportarlos fácilmente, porque China no acepta a sus ciudadanos que son deportados de Estados Unidos. Esto puede ser otro incentivo para la inmigración china, ya que las autoridades de inmigración estadounidenses no pueden detener indefinidamente a las personas y, por tanto, deben liberarlas en Estados Unidos cuando no puedan ser devueltas a sus países de origen. ""Las devoluciones efectivas son la piedra angular de un sistema migratorio funcional y creíble"", escribió en diciembre de 2022 el Migration Policy Institute, entidad no partidista. ""Si los migrantes irregulares enfrentan poco riesgo de deportación, tienen menos razones para cumplir con las órdenes de irse voluntariamente"". Aun así, no hay pruebas de que el repunte de la migración china en la frontera se deba a una directiva del Partido Comunista Chino. Y ""no hay nada inusual en que los migrantes de cualquier país estén en 'edad militar'"", dijo a PolitiFact en 2023 Adam Isacson, director de supervisión de defensa de Washington Office on Latin America, un grupo que aboga por los derechos humanos en las Américas. Isacson también dijo que no es inusual que la gente huya de la persecución de países que tienen malas relaciones con Estados Unidos. Clayton Dube, investigador principal del Instituto EE.UU.-China de la Universidad del Sur de California, dijo que no ha visto ninguna prueba de que los emigrantes chinos vengan a EE.UU. ""motivados por otra cosa que no sea el deseo individual de forjarse una nueva vida en EE.UU.""

"Can social media platform outages impact U.S. elections? Not likely, experts say","March 6, 2024",Madison Czopek,"Elections, Technology","It’s Election Day in November 2024. Across the U.S., voters are heading to the polls. And major social media platforms are not working. The scenario could alarm voters and draw news organizations’ attention. But would it affect voting? A similar incident played out March 5, when Meta platforms including Facebook, Instagram and Threads stopped working worldwide for about two hours. The outages happened on Super Tuesday, when voters in 16 states and one territory were casting their ballots in the presidential primary. DownDetector, a website that tracks outages using methods including user-submitted reports, said that more than 500,000 Facebook outages and 79,000 Instagram outages were reported around 10:30 a.m Eastern Time. The issue appeared to be resolved and access restored within a few hours. X users speculated that the outages were linked to the election, nefarious — and possibly a trial run for a bigger incident in November. ""All major socials went down and regained at almost the exact same time,"" read one X post with more than 39,000 views as of March 5. ""#cyberattack or practice run for the 2024 election? It is no coincidence that this happened on Super Tuesday, because there are no coincidences."" Roger Stone, a Republican political consultant in Florida who advised former President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, suggested the outage might have benefitted Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley. ""Facebook and Instagram — two of the most powerful communication tools for grassroots politics in America — suddenly stops working on #SuperTuesday, while all of Haley’s ads in print, radio, and television remain intact,"" Stone wrote. ""How convenient."" Haley, the former United Nations ambassador, dropped out of the presidential race the next day. During the primary season, the Trump campaign or his super political action committee backers have bought radio ads, television spots and text message and direct mail advertising. Another X post that racked up more than 1.7 million views questioned whether the outages were a ""practice run for November,"" when the general election will take place. Federal officials told reporters on Super Tuesday that they knew of no link between the outage and that day’s elections. Local and state election officials in Alabama, California, Colorado, North Carolina and Texas told us that the Meta outages did not affect voting. Many election officials told us that they communicate with voters on their websites or by opt-in text messages and emails. In North Carolina, officials sent an emergency robocall to correct misinformation about voting instructions.  Super Tuesday voters leave a polling location Tuesday, March 5, 2024, in Mount Holly, N.C. (AP) White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters during a March 5 press briefing that the White House was ""not aware of any specific malicious cyberactivity,"" she said. ""Or any specific nexus as it relates to today’s election."" A U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency official made a similar statement in a briefing with reporters. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone posted on X that ""a technical issue caused people to have difficulty accessing some of our services."" PolitiFact contacted Meta for additional details and was directed to Stone’s statement. (PolitiFact has a fact-checking partnership with Meta.  (Clip from YouTube.) Many local and state election officials use multiple social media platforms to communicate with voters and the media on election days. Government officials post information about voting hours, turnout, the counting process and voter problems or misinformation. Some are playful – Harris Votes in Texas posted a video of what voting looks like during rodeo season (in cowboy boots, of course.) But social media is not the only way election officials communicate with voters. Local elections offices typically have websites where information is posted, such as voting site locations. Derek Bowens, Durham County, North Carolina’s elections director, told PolitiFact that the Meta outages didn’t affect Super Tuesday voting. Even if all social media platforms went down on Election Day, Durham County has a notification system through its emergency management department that it could use to send voting updates to the public. ""There is always a backup to the backup,"" Bowens said. Justin D. Grantham, clerk and recorder in Fremont County, Colorado, said if all social media platforms were disrupted for all of Election Day, clerks would use TV and radio to deliver messages to voters. ""It would change our tactics, but not our communication with our constituents,"" Grantham said.  Dressed as Superman and holding a ""Vote!"" flag, artist David Alcantar jogs past a polling site, March 5, 2024, in San Antonio. The flag and costume are part of an art project to encourage voting. (AP) Mara Suttmann-Lea, a Connecticut College assistant professor of politics, wrote in a 2021 paper that county election websites are ""by far the most commonly available resource for voters across jurisdictions."" The social media outages probably affected campaigns’ digital ads, said Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas, a group advocating for voting access. And the secretary of state ran digital ads letting people know what types of identification they needed to vote. ""A number of us who work on voting rights talked about how we ran into so many people yesterday while shopping for groceries or picking up kids at school who had no idea it was Election Day,"" Gutierrez said. ""The outage may have prevented some people from hearing about the election or kept people from getting reminders to go vote, but it's hard to imagine it had any significant impact."" Lillian Govus, spokesperson for North Carolina’s Buncombe County, said primary turnout was higher than in 2020, so the county has no indication that the outage impacted access. ""At the end of the day, if social media or power went down, we’d vote exactly like I did when I voted for the first time in 1998: on a ballot machine that used a touchscreen for selections and without any social media platform competing for my attention,"" Govus said.

"Energy weapons, blue roofs and food supply attacks: Texas wildfires revive baseless claims","March 6, 2024",Jeff Cercone,"National, Texas","As Texas tries to contain the biggest wildfire in the state’s history, baseless conspiracy theories that first circulated online after other well-known fires are resurfacing. More than 1 million acres of land have burned so far in Texas from the wildfires, which began in late February. The Smokehouse Creek fire, the largest of the fires, has killed at least two people and thousands of animals in a state known for its cattle industry. False claims about government attacks with directed energy weapons and certain homes painted blue being spared that first surfaced last year during devastating wildfires in Maui, Hawaii, are now being applied to Texas. Other social media users have revived a long-running conspiracy about attacks on the U.S. food supply by nefarious, unnamed forces. Here are some of the false claims circulating on social media about the Texas wildfires. In the past two years, PolitiFact has debunked numerous claims that unknown actors are attacking the nation’s food supply, targeting farms and food processing facilities to starve people. The claim of food supply attacks resurfaced after wildfires ravaged ranges in the Texas Panhandle and killed thousands of livestock animals. This claim is False. There’s no evidence the fires were set intentionally and experts we spoke with said the fires’ effect on the nation’s food supply likely would be minimal. Texas authorities, as of March 6, continue to investigate the Smokehouse Creek fire’s cause, but they have not suggested it was intentionally ignited. Hot weather, dry land and high winds have helped spread the still-burning blaze. One homeowner has sued a utility company for not maintaining a damaged power pole, alleging downed power lines started the fire. (Instagram screenshot) Some social media users said a video of a green laser beam is evidence that directed energy weapons were used to start the Texas wildfires. This claim is False. The green laser beam video predates the Texas wildfires. It was shared online as early as Dec. 31, 2023, from an account known for videos that purport to show paranormal or extraterrestrial activity. Other online claims baselessly alleged that directed energy weapons were used to start deadly fires that ravaged Maui in August 2023; wildfires there killed more than 100 people and destroyed thousands of buildings in the town of Lahaina. PolitiFact has also debunked similar claims that those weapons were used to start fires in Canada and Russia. Directed energy weapons are real, and the United States and other countries are researching them for military purposes, but there’s no evidence they were used to ignite the Texas wildfires. Social media users took comments that Biden made about a home that avoided burning during the Texas wildfires to revive a conspiracy theory that first surfaced in the Maui wildfires. ""If you fly over these areas that are burned to the ground, you’ll see in the midst of 20 homes that are just totally destroyed, one home sitting there because it had the right roof on it,"" Biden said. One Instagram post showed the clip of Biden with text saying, ""Remember the blue roofs during the Lahaina fires? Biden just seemed to confirm our suspicions."" This claim is False. ""Blue roofs"" refers to baseless claims that celebrities were painting their Maui roofs blue and that those homes were spared by directed energy weapons. Experts we spoke to about the Maui claims said it’s common for fires to ""hop"" from place to place via flying embers and for some structures or trees not to ignite, even if everything around them does. Biden was not talking about roof colors, a longer video of his comments shows. He was saying some roofs were intact because the structures were up to code, not because they were painted blue. (Instagram screenshot) A Facebook post claimed a photo showed the Texas wildfire, but the image was first posted in 2017. This claim is False. A reverse-image search showed the photo was from an August 2017 Texas Monthly article about a fire in Gray County, Texas. PolitiFact staff writers Sara Swann and Loreben Tuquero contributed to this report."
Why do so many Americans think the economy is bad when the data says otherwise?,"March 6, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"Economy, Jobs, Polls and Public Opinion","Talk about a disconnect. Unemployment is near record lows. Job creation is robust. The economy is growing, driven by healthy consumer spending. And the stock market has hit record highs. Yet surveys show that Americans are disgusted with the economy. And President Joe Biden, seeking reelection in November, is feeling the public’s agitation. Biden has struggled to convince voters that the economy is strong — or that he deserves any credit for his economic stewardship. In a February Marquette Law School poll, 35% of national respondents said the economy was ""excellent"" or ""good,"" compared with 65% who said it was ""not so good"" or ""poor."" A February Monmouth University poll primed respondents with several metrics showing a strong economy — including ""lower unemployment, higher productivity and a high Dow Jones average"" — before asking whether their family had benefited. But sentiments stayed dour. Only 33% told the pollster their family had benefited either ""a great deal"" or ""some"" from the ""economic upturn,"" compared with 64% who said they had benefited ""not much"" or ""not at all."" Voters are giving Donald Trump — who’s seeking to return to the White House — more love on the economy than they’re giving Biden. In a late February-early March CBS News poll, almost two-thirds of respondents nationally said the economy was good under Trump, while 39% said the same of today’s economy under Biden. Why are Americans so glum about an economy that is strong on the numbers? It seems inflation and high interest rates are blotting out every other metric for the average American, combined with self-reinforcing doom loops of media coverage and partisan biases. The biggest albatross for Biden’s economy is inflation. Year-over-year inflation peaked around 9% — a four-decade high — in summer 2022. It has fallen to about 3% in recent months, closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Economists generally attribute the peak inflation to supply chain problems that emerged during the pandemic; this was exacerbated by fiscal stimulus legislation signed by Biden shortly after he took office. Americans ""want these prices to be back where they were before the pandemic,"" Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook said in a November speech at Duke University. The problem is that, by nature, inflation doesn’t act that way. When inflation slows, as it has for a year and a half, it doesn’t produce lower prices. Rather, prices climb more slowly, allowing wage increases to catch up. Americans have noticed that food prices are up 20% on Biden’s watch. ""Most people shop for groceries every week, making those prices particularly salient,"" A. Lee Hannah, a Wright State University political scientist who has written about consumers’ views of the economy, told PolitiFact. Another weekly ritual is a trip to the gas station. Although gasoline prices have fallen substantially from their summer 2022 peak, they remain about 30% higher than when Biden took office. Two long-running consumer confidence measures illustrate inflation’s unique impact on public sentiment about the economy. The University of Michigan produces one survey. Although this monthly metric has rebounded over the past year, the rating under Biden remains lower than it was for four of the past five presidents at the same point in their tenures. For more than two years through December 2023, the survey’s consumer sentiment score was lower than it was at April 2020 — a startling finding, given that in April 2020 the unemployment rate was 13.2% and Americans were facing the uncertainty of a once-a-century pandemic. The Conference Board, a business membership and research organization, conducts another monthly consumer confidence survey. By this gauge, consumer sentiment is now higher than it was under three of the previous four presidents at this point in their tenures. There’s a straightforward explanation: The surveys ask different questions. The University of Michigan survey is more sensitive to inflation, and the Conference Board’s measure tends to reflect labor market conditions, such as today’s low unemployment rate and rapid job creation. The government’s primary cure for inflation is raising interest rates, which is causing a different kind of consumer heartburn. Interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve — which have largely succeeded in reducing inflation — have also sent mortgage and credit card rates higher, squeezing borrowers and homebuyers, especially those who are entering the housing market for the first time. A significant number of Americans, Hannah said, ""are gainfully employed, have seen their wages rise, and are enjoying cheaper gas — but they remain pessimistic because some of these larger purchases like homes or cars seem unattainable right now."" Compounding Biden’s challenge is that, adjusted for inflation, wages haven’t quite caught up to price growth. Given current trends, inflation-adjusted wages should soon arrive back at the purchasing power they had when Biden was inaugurated. Still, this means that Americans have felt like they’ve been falling behind on prices for three full years under Biden. Low-income Americans feel this pain the most, because a higher percentage of their income is taken up by food, gasoline and other necessities with prices that inflation has affected most. The resumption of federal student loan payments in late 2023 might also be contributing to some Americans feeling less well-off, economists said. ""Consumers' income growth has finally started to offset inflation, but while the trend is good, there's still a bit of ground to cover for people's purchasing power to get back its longer-run trend,"" said Sasha Indarte, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. Many Americans pay little attention to broad economic statistics, which leads to misconceptions, economists said. A December Bankrate survey found that about six of 10 respondents said the U.S. economy was in a recession — when a recession was never declared. A Financial Times survey found that 90% of respondents said prices have risen faster than wages over the past year, even though the opposite is true. If news organizations are trying to correct these misconceptions, the message isn’t getting through, said Aaron Sojourner, a senior researcher at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. In a January analysis, Sojourner and a co-author used a San Francisco Federal Reserve database that rates whether economic news coverage is tonally positive or negative. The analysis found that since 2018, economic news coverage has grown increasingly negative — and ""increasingly unmoored from economic fundamentals."" Sojourner has found a widening gap during that period between people who believed their local economy was ""good"" or ""excellent"" and people who felt similarly about the national economy. ""Because people rely more on news to understand the national economy than their local economy or their personal finances, this provides some evidence that negative news sentiment plays a role,"" Sojourner told PolitiFact. One example of a media mismatch is that despite many recent stories about how young people have given up on ever owning a home, the homeownership rate for young people is higher today than it was in 2016, said Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. Baker said recent news coverage also misses other economic positives. ""I have seen virtually zero mention of the 17 million additional people who are able to work from home, saving thousands of dollars in commuting-related expenses and hundreds of hours spent commuting,"" Baker added. ""Almost no one is familiar with the surveys of workplace satisfaction, which report record highs."" Responses to surveys have become increasingly driven by partisanship. In the February Monmouth poll, 83% of Republicans said they had benefited ""not much"" or ""not at all"" from the economy, compared with 38% of Democrats who said they hadn’t benefited much. Independents were almost as negative as Republicans, with 72% saying they hadn’t benefited much. These sentiments can flip without any change in economic fundamentals — only a change in political party. Republican sentiment surged and Democratic sentiment ""plunged between November 2016 and January 2017, and vice versa in 2020-2021"" — when the party controlling the White House switched parties, Joanne W. Hsu, consumer surveys director at the University of Michigan, wrote of her survey results. Beyond dollars-and-cents metrics, the world is awash in strife, with wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, and the U.S. is riven by culture-war controversies, all juiced by an unceasing flow of charged rhetoric on social media. It would be a surprise if none of this seeped into perceptions of the economy. Then again, Yahoo Finance senior columnist Rick Newman wrote in March, ""if ‘poor’ is the American public's baseline understanding of the economy when things are pretty good, we’re going to need some new terminology to describe what’s going to happen when another recession strikes, which is inevitable."""
Is Donald Trump’s NATO talk a warning or a negotiating tactic? Here’s what he has said,"March 6, 2024",Matthew Crowley,"National, Congress, Foreign Policy, Russia","When former President Donald Trump said he’d let Russia ""do whatever the hell they want"" to NATO nations that didn’t pay for collective defense, he alarmed world leaders — and spurred President Joe Biden to imagine a world without the alliance. Biden in February asked voters to contemplate this scenario — Trump winning the election and withdrawing the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. ""First of all, he doesn’t like NATO,"" Biden said at a Feb. 21 campaign event. ""He wanted to pull out of it completely. He has no notion of its importance."" Biden added, ""Imagine what happens if this guy gets elected and steps out of NATO. Imagine what that does."" Recent polls show Americans support NATO. And political observers say Trump’s comments have undermined NATO, which may obliquely help Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long wanted to weaken the alliance. But is pulling out Trump’s plan? Some former Trump advisers have said Trump nearly removed the U.S. from NATO and that U.S. involvement in the alliance could be in jeopardy if he wins reelection. As a 2024 candidate, he’s again raising doubts about the organization’s merits, but he hasn’t said for sure whether he’d pull the U.S. out. We asked the Trump campaign for comment and didn’t hear back. Experts cautioned against pinning Trump to a single position, given his unpredictability. As president, ""he didn't follow through on everything he said he would do and changed his mind often,"" said Jennifer Kavanagh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. Case in point: In 2016, Trump repeatedly said that NATO was ""obsolete"" or ""outdated."" As president, he remained skeptical of NATO but flip-flopped on its relevance. During an April 2017 press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump said NATO was doing more to fight terrorism and ""it’s no longer obsolete."" Here’s Trump’s history when talking about NATO and what it could mean for the alliance in a potential second term. U.S. President Donald Trump addresses a news conference after a summit of heads of state and government July 12, 2018, at NATO headquarters in Brussels. (AP) Trump’s position that allies should spend more has been fairly consistent since the 1980s. In a 1987 interview with CNN’s Larry King, Trump said, ""If you look at the payments that we're making to NATO, they're totally disproportionate with everybody else's."" In his 2000 book, Trump wrote that exiting NATO would save the United States ""millions of dollars"" a year. He turned the observation into a threat as a presidential candidate. ""Either they have to pay up for past deficiencies or they have to get out,"" Trump said at an April 2016 campaign stop in Racine, Wisconsin. ""And if it breaks up NATO, it breaks up NATO,"" he concluded. At an August 2016 rally in Jacksonville, Florida, Trump framed the issue as a negotiator would, saying, ""I don’t want to get rid of NATO, but you always have to be prepared to walk. It’s possible."" He reenacted an interview with The New York Times for the crowd: ""They said, ‘What happens if one of these countries’ — take a smaller one that nobody in this room’s ever heard of — ‘gets attacked by Russia? Are you saying you’re not gonna protect ’em?’ I say, ‘Well, let me ask you: Have they paid? Have they paid?’ Right? ‘Have they paid?’"" Almost eight years later, Trump’s sentiment is similar. In February, Trump told supporters a similar anecdote about telling an unnamed NATO country leader that he would ""encourage"" Russia to ""do whatever the hell they want"" to a NATO member country that didn’t ""pay."" Some Trump allies dismissed Trump’s comments as off-the-cuff remarks. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who was former Vice President Mike Pence’s national security adviser, told Politico he did not take Trump ""literally."" Some fears that Trump would withdraw from NATO stem from comments by former Trump advisers. John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser who is now a Trump critic, wrote in his 2020 book that during an August 2019 videoconference about U.S. assistance to Ukraine, Trump said, ""I don’t give a s--- about NATO."" Trump then ordered Pence to call NATO’s Stoltenberg to tell him the alliance should pay Ukraine $250 million in assistance for weapons, equipment, intelligence support and training to build up Ukraine’s military and to deter Russia. Trump has said he was tough on Russia, and some moves bear that out. For example, the additional $1.4 billion he sought in fiscal 2108 for the European Deterrence Initiative, which supports European military readiness to counter Russian aggression, was a 41% increase from the allocation during President Barack Obama’s final year in office. But rhetorically, he’s been friendlier to Russia than his predecessors. In June 2018,  he advocated for restoring Russia to the G-7 after it was expelled in 2014 over annexing Crimea. Also in 2018, Trump, against his advisers’ wishes, congratulated Putin on his reelection victory. Trump was inconsistent about whether he thought Russia meddled in the election, but he has said that he believes Putin’s denial of Russian involvement. Bolton told The Washington Post in a February story that he believes Trump will seek to kill the alliance. ""He’s never lost the desire to get out,"" Bolton said. Multiple former Trump advisers told Jim Sciutto, CNN's chief national security analyst, for Sciutto’s upcoming book that the United States may exit NATO if Trump wins reelection. Sciutto quotes John Kelly, Trump’s former White House chief of staff, as saying Trump ""saw absolutely no point in NATO."" Ivo Daalder, a U.S. ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama, in a January essay for Politico pointed to Trump’s comments in 2020 to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, which showed the former president saying the alliance was finished. ""You need to understand that if Europe is under attack, we will never come to help you and to support you,"" Trump said, according to French European Commissioner Thierry Breton. Trump then added, ""By the way, NATO is dead, and we will leave, we will quit NATO."" At times, Trump spoke publicly about NATO’s importance in the context of wanting allies to spend more on their own defense. Member nations are expected to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense, a show of military readiness, by 2024. ""I see NATO as a good thing to have,"" Trump told The Washington Post’s editorial board in 2016. ""No, I don’t want to pull (out of it)."" As president, Trump kept his promise to ask allies to pay more for joint defense. At a 2018 NATO summit, Trump said ""the United States’ commitment to NATO is very strong"" and then praised allies for putting up additional money. In a 2019 speech at the Pentagon, Trump said, ""We will be with NATO 100%, but as I told the countries, you have to step up."" In 2014, after Russia illegally annexed Crimea, NATO country leaders agreed to the 2% GDP goal. As of July 2023, NATO reported that 11 of 31 member countries had met the goal: Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, the United Kingdom and the United States. In 2023, Congress passed legislation to ban a president from unilaterally withdrawing from NATO. The legislation states that withdrawing from NATO would require approval by two-thirds of the U.S. Senate or an act of Congress. Trump was vague about NATO in an ""Agenda47"" video, a reference to becoming the 47th president, posted on his campaign website in 2023: ""Finally, we have to finish the process we began under my administration of fundamentally reevaluating NATO's purpose and NATO's mission."" Still, his comments made allied countries nervous. ""The very essence of NATO is America’s commitment to European security and its promise to defend its European partners,"" said Jeremy Shapiro, research director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""If Europeans lose faith in this commitment, the alliance will be, for all intents and purposes, dead — even if it appears America remains a member and it putters along in its Brussels headquarters."" It would take more than tough talk to break NATO ties. ""Relationships between NATO members are pretty well institutionalized in defense, diplomatic, and economic networks and so can withstand a good amount of pressure,"" Kavanagh said. RELATED: Why Donald Trump’s boast that he got ‘delinquent’ NATO allies to ‘pay up’ is misleading"
The deficit has fallen under Joe Biden. It’s still higher than before the pandemic.,"March 5, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"Debt, Deficit","President Joe Biden has often touted that his administration has cut the federal deficit, sometimes communicating that record more accurately than others. At campaign fundraisers in December and February, he told audience members that on his watch, the deficit fell by ""$7 billion."" The actual decline is more than $1 trillion, not billion. He used the more accurate figure in other appearances, including a Dec. 19 fundraiser in Bethesda, Maryland, and in Jan. 19 remarks to the U.S. Conference of Mayors at the White House. Before Biden’s third State of the Union address, we wanted to take a deeper look into the reasons for the declining deficit. Biden has presided over smaller deficits than the Donald Trump administration saw in its final year. However, Biden’s remarks omit important context about the unusual federal spending that both presidents approved to stabilize the country during the coronavirus pandemic. ""President Biden has presided over declining deficits, but that’s because the deficit started staggeringly high because of the pandemic,"" said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks federal spending. ""If you compare the deficit to pre-pandemic levels, they are incredibly high. Some of that is still residual effects from the pandemic response and higher interest rates, but it is also from increased spending and decreased revenues."" The deficit isn’t the same as the debt, although the terms are related. The federal deficit is calculated by subtracting federal spending from federal revenue, primarily tax collections, for a given year. If revenue exceeds spending, there’s a surplus for that year; if spending exceeds revenue, there’s a deficit. (There hasn’t been a federal surplus since 2001.) The national debt is the accumulation of all past deficits, minus any surpluses. A smaller deficit does not mean the federal debt has been reduced; only a surplus can do that. A smaller deficit means only that the debt grows more slowly than it did before. So, the debt has continued to rise under Biden. When Biden entered office, the broadest measure of the federal debt stood a little below $27.8 trillion. Currently, it’s around $34.4 trillion, an increase of almost one-fourth in just more than three years. The debt also rose under Trump, by about $7.8 trillion over his four years in office. Biden has spoken mostly about the annual deficit, not the debt, so we’ll consider that metric. During Trump’s presidency, the deficit rose from $666 billion in 2017, his first year in office, to $984 billion in 2019, his third year. But the coronavirus pandemic sent the annual deficit into record territory. In 2020, Trump’s fourth year, the deficit skyrocketed to $3.13 trillion, largely because of government stimulus payments, unemployment insurance expansions, business operation grants and increased funding for public health. The deficit remained high in 2021, another significant pandemic year. That year, the newly elected Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act, which provided more money for the pandemic response. In 2021, the deficit fell but remained historically high, at $2.78 trillion. The deficit declines were greater during Biden’s second and third years in office, as vaccines and therapies cut the risks associated with COVID-19 and the economy opened. The deficit was about $1.38 trillion in 2022 and $1.7 trillion in 2023. The $1.4 trillion decline in the deficit from 2021 to 2022 was larger than any previous one-year reduction in the deficit. Although Biden often touts the federal spending allocated in bills he’s signed — including the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — he’s also tried to promote the argument that he’s been responsible with the public purse, most recently at the fundraisers. The White House told PolitiFact that Biden deserves some credit for successfully tamping down the pandemic, which was aided by the administration’s embrace of vaccinations. Also, White House officials say that key legislation Biden signed, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, was written in a way to boost federal revenue enough to balance out the spending increases. The Fiscal Responsibility Act, which Biden signed in 2023 as a negotiated way to lift the debt limit, included spending curbs that were designed to reduce deficits from 2024 to 2033 by a collective $1.5 trillion, according to Congressional Budget Office projections. However, the pandemic was an extraordinary historical occurrence that provoked an aggressive, and temporary, government response. The other bills Biden signed, although large in dollars, are phasing in their spending over a decade. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit public policy group, told PolitiFact that by their estimate, more than 80% of the reduction in the deficit under Biden can be explained by expiring or shrinking COVID-19 relief. Even at its reduced levels, the deficit remains higher under Biden than it was pre-pandemic. The deficit in 2022 and 2023 under Biden was higher than in each of Trump’s first three years, partly because of bills such as the 2021 American Rescue Plan. The same pattern emerges when the deficit is compared with the U.S. gross domestic product, a common measure of the overall size of the economy. The deficit peaked at 14.7% of gross domestic product in 2020 and fell to 5.4% in 2022. That was still bigger than the highest pre-pandemic percentage under Trump, which was 4.6%."
"The Biden-versus-Trump economy: Who did better on inflation, jobs, gasoline prices and more?","March 4, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"Economy, Jobs, Workers","Get ready: In the 2024 presidential race, the candidates will talk about the economy. A lot. We know because it’s already happening. Incumbent President Joe Biden has touted the rapid growth of jobs on his watch. His predecessor and front-runner for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump, has focused on the four-decade-high inflation that peaked in summer 2022. Biden argues the economy has turned the corner on inflation. Trump, who leads former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley comfortably, counters that residual inflation continues to inflict economic pain. Voters are listening. When the Quinnipiac University poll asked respondents in February for what they thought was the most urgent issue facing the country, 20% said the economy — a close second behind preserving democracy at 21%. Among Republicans, 24% chose the economy (second to immigration at 35%) while 24% of independents picked the economy, making it their top issue. With the Super Tuesday primaries coming this week, PolitiFact decided to look at a few common economic talking points in the presidential race. We compared the nation’s economic performance not just under Biden and Trump but also under their three predecessors: Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. No president is all-powerful on economic matters. The severe but relatively brief interruption the coronavirus pandemic caused also makes comparisons tricky. And beyond the numbers are intangibles, such as leadership qualities. There’s no simple answer for who has been the better economic steward. On the numbers, Biden has some advantages over Trump, and vice versa. Other economic statistics show both presidents putting up impressive numbers during their first three years in office. (Looking at the first three years in office was the fairest comparison, as Trump’s fourth year was walloped by the coronavirus pandemic, and Biden’s fourth year is just 2 months old.) In January, Biden highlighted that Trump was the first president to oversee a net loss of jobs since Herbert Hoover, who was in office when the Great Depression hit — but failed to mention the 2020 pandemic caused the nosedive. When excluding the pandemic year of 2020, we found that the economy under Biden added jobs at a faster rate than under Trump — and faster than any of Biden’s recent predecessors. Under Biden, U.S. employment is now 10% above what it was when he was sworn in. Ranking second after three years is Clinton, with almost 8%, followed by Trump with 4.4%. Both Obama and Bush had fewer jobs filled after three years than they had on their first day in office. Biden benefited from favorable timing. He was inaugurated January 2021, as the pandemic started receding. Although the jobs recovery began under Trump, Biden was blessed with a steady flow of Americans moving back into jobs that had been hampered during the pandemic. Still, the simple return of workers sidetracked by the pandemic doesn’t explain all the job gains on Biden’s watch, even though Trump has tried to make that case. Employment data through Biden’s first three years in office significantly exceeds where the workforce stood before the pandemic. Given that job creation was leveling off during Trump’s last few months in office, ""it was not inevitable that we would get the huge bounceback we saw under Biden,"" said Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. Biden’s American Rescue Plan, a pandemic recovery bill passed weeks after Biden took office, ""was a huge deal here."" Another factor in the expanding labor market — though one that’s become a political two-edged sword — has been higher immigration rates under Biden. This has helped fuel the economy, according to analyses by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and others, even as it lets critics discuss chaos at the border. Biden has emphasized the growth of manufacturing jobs when touting bills he’s signed into law, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. The data shows that manufacturing jobs have grown by about 6.5% since Biden took office. Trump ranks second at 3.4%, followed by Clinton at 2.5%. Three years into their terms, Obama and Bush had both overseen losses in manufacturing jobs. Biden and Trump have dueling messages on inflation, which peaked north of 9% in summer 2022. Economists generally blame pandemic-era supply chain problems, with Biden’s aid package exacerbating the rise in prices. Biden has emphasized how much inflation has dropped. ""Wages are rising. Inflation is down,"" Biden said in a Feb. 12 speech in Washington, D.C., to the National Association of Counties. The following day, Biden applauded the release of new inflation statistics showing that prices had risen by 3.1% in the year ended January 2024, about one-third of the 2022 peak level. It remains a bit above the 2% that the Federal Reserve wants to see before lowering interest rates. The biggest reasons inflation has eased, economists have told us, are factors that the administration doesn’t control: Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, a global oil price decline and a slowdown in China’s economy. Inflation did not hamper Trump. During his first three years in office, Trump saw wages outpace inflation — the opposite of Biden. For Biden, the data is improving, but that picture depends heavily on the time frame used. If you start with Biden’s first day in office, prices have risen faster than wages — never a good sign for a president seeking reelection. ""In 2021 and 2022, people went to work and fell further behind,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum. ""They are not over it, despite the gains in 2023."" However, wage growth on Biden’s watch is on pace to exceed price growth within a couple of months. Also, wages have outpaced inflation for more than a year now, and wages have also outpaced inflation since Jan. 2020, the final month before the pandemic. One difference between the Biden and Trump economies is data showing that the wage increases under Biden have been especially robust for poorer people. Trump could make plenty of accurate claims about the pain of inflation. However, he has exaggerated how much prices have risen for bacon, overall food and gasoline. In December, Trump said gasoline prices ""are now $5, $6, $7 and even $8 a gallon."" We rated that claim Mostly False, because just a few gasoline stations nationally had prices that high. The nationwide average per-gallon price at the time was $3.14. Gasoline prices have been unusually high under Biden, although they’ve dropped from their $5-per-gallon peak. That decline has stemmed from increased production, including in the United States, and the oil market’s realignment after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, which drove Western nations to restrict purchases of Russian oil. Today, gasoline prices remain about one-third higher than they were when Biden took office. That’s a bigger percentage increase after three years than under Clinton, Bush or Trump. Obama fared worse; gasoline prices were 89% higher at his three-year mark. On several key metrics, Biden and Trump both have records to celebrate. In June 2023, Biden touted the low unemployment rate on his watch, saying that it has been ""below 4% for the longest stretch in 50 years in American history."" We rated this Mostly True. Unemployment has remained low partly because companies have more jobs to fill than available applicants; that has drawn some Americans back to work. However, Trump also oversaw low unemployment rates. During Trump’s first three years in office, the unemployment rate averaged 4%; during Biden’s first three years, which included a few months when unemployment was still settling down after pandemic job losses, the average has been 4.2%.  Meanwhile, a measure called the ""misery index"" adds the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. After spiking when inflation was highest in summer 2022, the metric has fallen to a level lower than it was under Clinton, Bush and Obama at the end of year three. Trump’s misery index was lower at this point in his presidency, but Biden’s current level is lower than it was when Trump left office. Biden has also trumpeted the growth in the most basic measurement of economic output: gross domestic product, or the collective value of all goods and services made in the U.S.. In January he called a 3.1% expansion in the economy during the fourth quarter of 2023 ""good news for American families and American workers. That is three years in a row of growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up on my watch."" If you ignore the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, the annual GDP growth rates under the two most recent presidents have been similar, ranging from about 2% to 3%. That range was also typical under Obama’s presidency and for much of Bush’s, except for the two toughest years of the Great Recession, 2008 and 2009.  Meanwhile, Biden has recently taken to touting the stock market’s health, saying on X, ""The stock market going strong is a sign of confidence in America’s economy."" As president, Trump often trumpeted stock market gains, although he’s dismissed the gains under Biden as helping only rich people (incorrectly — more than half the public owns stocks.) Either way, both presidents have overseen rising share prices. During Trump’s first three years, the S&P 500, a broad stock market gauge, rose by 1,050 points. In Biden’s first three years, it has risen by 988 points. (Since Jan. 20, 2024, the S&P has risen an additional 287 points.) "
Critics say an Aldi job ad excluded white people. We took a closer look.,"March 1, 2024",Jeff Cercone,"National, Jobs, Race and Ethnicity","An Aldi supermarkets employment ad has some conservatives complaining on social media that it shows the German-owned discount grocer is no longer hiring white people. A woman in a Feb. 4 Instagram video said, ""Guys, you missed it. Aldi is hiring everybody but white people."" As evidence of her claim, the woman read from a LinkedIn job listing Jobs for Humanity posted for a national procurement specialist that read: ""Jobs for Humanity is partnering with Aldi to build an inclusive and just employment ecosystem. Therefore, we prioritize individuals coming from the following communities: Refugee, Neurodivergent, Single Parent, Blind or Low Vision, Deaf or Hard of Hearing, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Military Veterans, the Elderly, the LGBTQ, and Justice Impacted individuals. This position is open to candidates who reside in and have the legal right to work in the country where the job is located."" The woman also read from a separate job search page on Aldi’s website that discussed diversity, equity and inclusion at the company. These efforts aim to diversify workforces by including underrepresented groups, such as ethnic minorities, older people and LGBTQ+ people. High-profile conservatives have criticized the job ad on social media. Libs of TikTok, for example, wrote on X that Aldi ""will prioritize everyone except straight white people."" X owner Elon Musk replied to the post, writing, ""racism is racism, no matter who it is directed at."" Jobs for Humanity’s website says the company’s goal is ""connecting historically underrepresented talent to welcoming employers."" The website further says that millions of people in groups such as visually impaired workers, single mothers and refugees ""face a disproportionate lack of opportunity in the job market."" ""Jobs for Humanity is an employment platform dedicated to providing accessible job opportunities for everyone, regardless of ethnicity,"" Roy Baladi, the company’s co-founder, said. Baladi said Jobs for Humanity coaches job seekers; creates job boards for groups such as neurodivergent people or single parents; trains recruiters on topics such as creating accessible career pages for visually impaired people; and promotes inclusive interview processes to minimize potential biases. Aldi did not answer our request for comment, but Baladi said his company, not Aldi, wrote the job ad in the Instagram post. Aldi  hires candidates who answer the ad, not Jobs for Humanity. Job postings on Aldi’s LinkedIn page do not contain the language in the Instagram post, but do include language such as ""ALDI is committed to equal opportunity for all employees and applicants,"" language that is typically seen in many job ads. On Aldi’s webpage about diversity, equity and inclusion, the company said it seeks  ""an employee base that better represents the communities we serve, which means retaining a more diverse population of candidates at all levels of the company."" Baladi said the claim that Aldi is not hiring white people is false, and that Jobs for Humanity does not discriminate. ""We are not discriminatory in any way and have successfully placed at least 100 individuals who may identify as caucasian in jobs,"" Baladi said, referring to overall job placements. ""We never intended to imply anyone is excluded, and we have refined the language in our job advertisements to reflect this commitment to inclusivity."" The language change was not in response to the conservatives’ criticism of the Aldi ad, but to similar feedback his organization received from people who said they felt excluded by the agency’s language, Baladi said. Jobs for Humanity lists no current job openings for Aldi on its website or LinkedIn page, but other ads we found on its LinkedIn page have language that reads, ""Jobs for Humanity is partnering with Nielsen to build an inclusive and just employment ecosystem. Therefore, we prioritize individuals coming from all walks of life."" However, other listings on its LinkedIn pages have language similar to the Aldi ad. Some conservatives, including former President Donald Trump, have recently criticized companies’ diversity, equity and inclusion efforts arguing these efforts are discriminatory and that hiring should hinge on merit. In July, 13 Republican attorneys general sent a letter to Fortune 100 CEOs that warned the Supreme Court’s overturning of affirmative action in college admissions in June should be a warning to every employer about factoring race in hiring decisions. The letter asked the executives to ""immediately cease any unlawful race-based quotas or preferences your company has adopted for its employment and contracting practices."" Twenty-one Democratic attorneys general responded with their own letter, urging companies not to be intimidated into ceasing DEI efforts. Most employment law experts we spoke with said the Jobs for Humanity ad isn’t proof that Aldi is not hiring white people. But some of the experts called the ad’s language problematic and said it could be used against Aldi in a discrimination lawsuit. ""The ad by itself does not prove that Aldi is not hiring white people,"" City University of New York School of Law professor Rick Rossein told PolitiFact in an email. But, he said, ""It could be offered as circumstantial evidence as proof of discrimination because of race.""

Rossein pointed to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. The EEOC website, in a section on job advertisements, said it’s illegal for a job ad to show a preference for or discourage people from applying because of race. Three of the 12 categories the ad said would be prioritized, were race-specific: Black, Asian and Hispanic. The other nine categories — including elderly people and military veterans — could include whites or any other ethnic group, experts said. Phyllis Towzey, a Florida employment lawyer, said the Aldi ad is seeking applicants from a wide range of groups that are underrepresented in the workforce. She said it’s an example of diversity recruiting and aims to ensure all candidates have a fair shot. ""The ad does not suggest that white people should not apply or will not be hired,"" Towzey said. UCLA law professor Noah Zatz said ""many of the groups listed undoubtedly are majority white, so the idea that the ad implies not hiring white people is plainly wrong."" University of Arizona law professor Christopher Griffin also said he sees nothing in the job posting that shows white people won’t be hired. He pointed to language at the bottom of the job posting in which Aldi stated its nondiscrimination policy and wrote, ""We do not discriminate based on race"" and other factors. ""Statements of preference in employment, whether or not they are legally valid, tend not to categorically exclude groups protected by state and federal law,"" Griffin said. ""Simply stated, prioritization is not the same thing as exclusion."" Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Richard Gonzalez said discrimination lawsuits hinge largely on intent. And, he said, litigants increasingly use DEI language such as this as evidence of an ""intent to favor minorities."" Texas A&M University law professor Michael Green seized on the ad’s use of the word ""prioritize.""

The context behind Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s dueling immigration speeches at the Texas border,"March 1, 2024",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"Immigration, Border Security","The two 2024 presidential election front-runners traveled to Texas on Feb. 29 to deliver vastly different messages about a key election issue: immigration. Former President Donald Trump stoked fear about the people crossing the southern U.S. border, citing recent high-profile criminal cases in which authorities charged immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally. President Joe Biden blamed Republicans for sidelining a Senate immigration bill he said would have given his administration the resources and powers needed to reduce illegal immigration. Speaking at Eagle Pass, Texas, the epicenter of a feud between the state and the federal government, Trump joined Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the Border Patrol union’s leader and Texas National Guard members. A few minutes after Trump spoke and about 300 miles south, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, and Border Patrol agents joined Biden as he spoke in Brownsville, Texas. Trump spent the hours before his speech blasting Biden’s immigration policies over social media and in a Daily Mail article, and positioning himself as the only person able to ""stop Biden’s illegal immigrant invasion."" At the end of his speech, Biden asked Trump to join him in getting Congress to pass the Senate border security bill. ""Instead of playing politics with the issue, why don't we just get together and get it done,"" Biden said. PolitiFact listened to both presidential candidates. Biden overstated the authority provided to him in the border security bill. Trump made broad and often unsubstantiated statements about the migrants entering the U.S. and his administration’s immigration successes. Here’s the context behind some of their statements.  President Joe Biden talks with the U.S. Border Patrol, as he looks over the southern border, Feb. 29, 2024, in Brownsville, Texas, along the Rio Grande. (AP) The Senate bill ""would also give me as president, or any of the next presidents, emergency authority to temporarily shut down the border between ports of entry."" — Biden in Brownsville The Senate proposal, which failed 49-50, sought to enable the executive branch to block people from seeking asylum in between ports of entry if illegal immigration encounters reached certain levels. That doesn’t mean people would stop coming to U.S. borders. A public health policy to mitigate COVID-19’s spread that was in place from March 2020 to May 2023 also largely blocked people from seeking asylum, but border encounters rose. ""There is this idea that we control how many migrants attempt illegal crossings. We do not,"" Theresa Cardinal Brown, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s senior adviser for Immigration and border policy previously told PolitiFact. ""We control what happens once we encounter someone who has already crossed the border illegally."" Under current immigration law, people on U.S. soil are allowed to seek asylum regardless of how they entered the country. The bill’s emergency authority tried to change that. But the government’s ability to quickly remove people from the U.S. would still hinge on its resources, and other countries’ willingness to take back immigrants. ""In short, there is no authority that Congress could pass that would allow for a ‘complete and total shutdown of the border,’"" Brown told us in February. ""That's just not how borders work in any real sense. Especially not our border with Mexico.""  Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump talks with Maj. Gen. Thomas Suelzer, Adjutant General for the State of Texas, at Shelby Park during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border, Feb. 29, 2024, in Eagle Pass, Texas. (AP) The person charged with a Georgia nursing student’s murder ""is an illegal alien migrant who was led into our country and released into our communities by ‘Crooked Joe’ Biden,"" — Trump in Eagle Pass. Laken Riley, a 22-year old nursing student at the University of Georgia, was killed while on a run Feb. 22. Authorities charged Jose Ibarra with the murder. Ibarra, a 26-year old from Venezuela, was stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection when he illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in September 2022, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Ibarra was paroled in, allowing him to be released into the U.S. to await further immigration proceedings. There is conflicting information on whether he was arrested in New York City. ICE told PolitiFact the New York Police Department arrested Ibarra on Aug. 31, 2023, and charged him with ""acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation."" ICE said the police released him before immigration authorities were able to issue a detainer request for him. But NYPD told PolitFact there were no arrests filed under the name ""Jose Ibarra"" in 2023. Despite high-profile cases of crimes committed by, or charged to immigrants in the U.S. illegally, research shows that immigrants are not more likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born people. A 2023 Stanford University study found immigrants are 30% less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the U.S. Research published in 2024 by the libertarian Cato Institute found that in Texas, immigrants in the U.S. illegally have a lower homicide conviction rate than people born in the U.S. ""We ended catch and release,"" — Trump in Eagle Pass. This is misleading and doesn’t reflect what happened. Republicans often use the term ""catch and release"" to describe immigration authorities stopping immigrants at the border and releasing them so they can await their court hearings outside of federal custody. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have followed this practice for decades, because there’s limited detention space and court rulings have capped how long someone can be detained. In January 2017, Trump signed an executive order to end ""catch and release."" But a few months later, his own attorney general testified to the Senate that the practice continued because of the long case backlog and an immigration judges shortage. ""We built 571 miles of border wall, much more than I promised I'd build,"" — Trump in Eagle Pass. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to build a border wall along at least 1,000 miles of the nearly 2,000-mile U.S. southern border. He did not fulfill that promise. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data says the Trump administration built barriers along 458 miles. But the majority of that construction replaced existing smaller, dilapidated barriers and did not add to the total miles of southern border barriers. The amount of new primary barriers added — 52 miles — is about 10 times less than Trump’s estimate. Primary barriers are the first impediment people encounter when they’re trying to cross the southern border with Mexico, they can block people who are walking or driving.

"Yes, a Maricopa County voter received two mail ballots. That’s not a sign of wrongdoing or fraud.","February 29, 2024",Amy Sherman,"Elections, Arizona","After an Arizona voter posted a photo showing she received two mail ballots from Maricopa County, a local elections official debunked any inference that something sinister occurred. ""Maricopa county at its finest … My first time ever voting in a presidential preference election and I received not one but two mail-in ballots. Thank you @stephen_richer,"" Aubrey Savela posted on X. Maricopa county at its finest… My first time ever voting in a presidential preference election and I received not one but two mail-in ballots 🫣Thank you @stephen_richer pic.twitter.com/DSLtZK4SU9 Savela is a field representative for Turning Point Action, a conservative group founded by Charlie Kirk. Richer, Maricopa County recorder and a Republican, responded on X  that there was a reason Savela received two ballots. And more importantly, he said, only one will be counted. ""You changed your voter registration on the last day of voter registration (Feb. 20) from your Chandler address to your new Tempe address,"" Richer wrote. ""Because early ballots must go out on Feb. 21, your Chandler ballot was already set to go out, and so it did. Then we sent out a new ballot to your Tempe address when we processed your voter registration modification."" Feb. 20 was the last day to register to vote in order to vote in the March 19 primary. Richer said Savela’s photo of her two ballots offered a clue that she had two different addresses because the lengths of the blacked-out redacted address lines were not the same on both envelopes. Also, Richer wrote, one of the ballot’s code numbers ends in ""01"" — which reflected Savela’s old address — and the other ends in ""02"", the new address. ""As soon as the ‘02’ one goes out, the ‘01’ packet is dead,"" Richer wrote. ""Meaning even if you sent it back, it wouldn't proceed to signature verification, and it wouldn't be opened. That's how we prevent people from voting twice. So just use the one with your new address ending in ‘02’ -— that's the only one that will work."" Richer often debunks voting misinformation and has faced death threats because of it. Alabama resident Brian Jerry Ogstad was arrested Feb. 28, accused of sending threatening messages to Maricopa election workers in 2022 including one that read, ""You will all be executed for your crimes."" Tammy Patrick, chief executive officer for programs at the Election Center at the National Association of Election Officials and a former Maricopa County elections official, said Savela’s post lacks understanding and important context. ""This is yet another example of standard operating procedures being taken out of context, misconstrued and misrepresented in order to support a false narrative regarding the legitimacy of our elections and the integrity of our election officials,"" Patrick said. It is not uncommon for voters who update their registration close to an election to receive two ballots, each with unique codes ensuring that only one will be counted, JP Martin, spokesperson for Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, told PolitiFact. ""Our voting systems are designed with robust safeguards against double voting,"" Martin said. Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, is home to more than half the state’s voters. The majority of Arizona voters cast mail ballots, as they have for decades. That’s why any misinformation about voting by mail is particularly harmful to democracy in the battleground state. Voters can do their part by updating their voter registration in a timely fashion, said Jenny Guzman, program director of Common Cause Arizona. But nationwide, election officials take similar steps to prevent double voting. Jurisdictions that send mail ballots have developed policies and systems to handle voters changing addresses at the last minute before ballots are mailed, said Barbara Smith Warner, executive director of the National Vote At Home Institute, an organization advocating for mail ballot access. ""It's not unusual for such voters to have already been mailed a ballot, and for the elections official to mail them a second ballot that reflects the races/contests appropriate for their new residence,"" Smith Warner said. Ballot return envelopes are coded and the election management system is programmed to alert the election official that a voter has been mailed two ballots. Election officials have systems to ensure that if the voter returns both ballots, only one is counted. Voter registration management systems are increasingly  sophisticated, making it rare for such a mistake to be made, Smith Warner said. However, post-election audits typically review these cases to ensure that proper procedures and state laws were followed, she said. Many states are members of the Electronic Registration Information Center, a consortium that shares voter registration lists. The center identifies voters with duplicate registrations in the same state or voters who have moved to another state. This helps prevent double voting. We found anecdotal examples in the news of voters receiving two mail ballots because of an error. In 2020, election officials in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, erroneously sent some residents multiple mail-in ballots ahead of the state’s June primary election. The county said a glitch in the state’s computerized voter registry system led it to accidentally print duplicate labels for mail-in and absentee ballots. ""Even if a person receives multiple ballots, only one return ballot can be counted. This is because the bar code on the label that is being used for tracking is exactly the same,"" a statement from the county said. ""When voted ballots are returned to the office, they are scanned. If another ballot was returned from that same voter, it would show as a duplicate vote when scanned and would be rejected by the system. Staff would mark the ballot as rejected. Those ballots are kept but are not sent to the warehouse to be counted or opened."" Of course, another way that double voting can occur is if a voter casts a mail ballot in two states in the same election. But that’s a crime. Four voters in The Villages, a largely conservative retirement community in central Florida, were arrested for voting more than once in the 2020 election.

Pregúntale a PolitiFact: ¿Qué son las tarjetas de débito ‘flex card’?,"February 29, 2024",Maria Briceño,"Health Care, Medicare, PolitiFact en Español","Muchas publicaciones en redes sociales dicen ofrecer una tarjeta llamada ""flex card"", que supuestamente se puede usar para pagar deudas, cubrir costos médicos y comprar comida. Aunque esto puede sonar como una gran solución para muchos, estos videos obvian información importante sobre estas tarjetas. PolitiFact ha investigado varias de estas publicaciones y hemos notado que usualmente tratan de estafar y confundir a las personas sobre este beneficio. Estas publicaciones suelen pedir que los usuarios sigan un enlace a una página con preguntas que supuestamente determinarán la elegibilidad para la tarjeta. Sin embargo, estos enlaces y números de teléfono proveídos no suelen corresponder a compañías de seguros médicos legítimas. Al preguntarles sobre la ""flex card,"" estos no dan respuestas concretas sin antes tener que proporcionarles información privada, como el seguro social. PolitiFact acá te aclara lo que debes saber sobre las flex cards. Las flex cards son tarjetas de débito prepagadas ofrecidas a beneficiarios de algunos planes de Medicare Advantage, los cuales generalmente ofrecen beneficios que el Medicare original no cubre como servicios de visión u odontología. Estas tarjetas pueden usarse principalmente para comprar equipo o servicios médicos aprobados por un médico. Sin embargo, no son proporcionadas por Medicare o el gobierno. El Medicare es un programa ofrecido en los Estados Unidos por los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid a ciudadanos o residentes de 65 años y más, o menores de edad si tienen discapacidades o fallo permanente de riñón. Para ser elegible, la persona tiene que ser ciudadana o residente, tener más de 65 años o una condición crónica y tener una póliza de Medicare Advantage. Pero no todos los planes de Medicare Advantage ofrecen estas tarjetas; la disponibilidad depende de varios factores, incluyendo el estado donde vive la persona. Los videos engañosos sobre las flex cards suelen decirle a los usuarios que solo tienen ""24 horas"" para aplicar a este beneficio, pero esto no es así. Esa es una táctica de manipulación que usan para urgir a las personas a actuar rápidamente. Aunque las personas tienen que asegurarse de inscribirse durante el periodo de inscripciones abiertas a un plan de Medicare Advantage que ofrezca la flex card, este periodo es de varios meses (del 1 de enero al 31 de marzo). Los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid recomiendan contactar directamente a su seguro médico para saber si el beneficio es ofrecido con su plan de Medicare Advantage y aplicar con ellos. También puede verificar los beneficios de su plan en la página web oficial de Medicare. Lo que puedes comprar con estas tarjetas de débito son servicios y productos específicos, principalmente médicos, y depende de tu plan médico. Estos incluyen: Equipo médico como silla de ruedas o muletas Copagos y deducibles no cubiertos por un seguro médico Prescripciones y medicamentos sin receta Cuidado dental, visión y auditivo Aunque los anuncios en redes sociales tienden a ofrecer múltiples beneficios con estas tarjetas como alimentos, gasolina, ropa nueva y zapatos, esto solo pasa en raras ocasiones, ya que un doctor debe ordenar estos artículos médicamente necesarios. También, solo personas con ciertas enfermedades crónicas pueden usar las tarjetas para algunos gastos en comida y comestibles. Y las tarjetas no son vagamente ""para todo lo que desees o necesites"" como dicen algunas publicaciones. El uso de las flex cards empezó en el 2020, cuando los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid permitieron a las aseguradoras privadas ofrecerlas para servicios específicos. Las flex cards tienen montos limitados que varían según el plan médico y la compañía aseguradora. Es raro recibir grandes montos como dicen algunas de las publicaciones engañosas. En el 2022, la flex card promedio estaba prepagada con un monto de $500. Los fondos en la tarjeta deben usarse durante el año específico en el que el pan fue seleccionado, ya que los planes pueden cambiar el tipo de cobertura que ofrecen anualmente, según los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid. Muchas de las publicaciones que PolitiFact ha visto son dirigidas a personas mayores y a Latinos. Este sector de la población puede ser el objetivo de las publicaciones ya que quizás están más aislados mientras sus hijos o nietos están en el trabajo y escuela, dijo Melissa deCardi Hladek, una profesora asistente y principal faculty del Center for Equity in Aging en el Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. ""Este aislamiento crea espacio para que los estafadores creen confianza y manipulen a los latinos mayores — tras el miedo, a veces una sensación de urgencia si ‘no actúan ahora’"", Hladek dijo. Ella también dijo que los latinos mayores pueden ser propensos a ser víctimas ya que ellos tienden a ser más respetuosos y menos conocedores de la tecnología. También son generalmente más religiosos y pueden considerar la oferta en el anuncio como un ""milagro"", Hladek dijo. Ella noto que muchos de los comentarios en las publicaciones dicen ""amén"" a la oportunidad presentada. El hecho de que las publicaciones estén en español también juega un papel importante. Hladek dijo que cuando alguien se comunica con una persona en el lenguaje que prefieren y usan señales culturales más familiares a ellos, la persona puede sentirse más atraída a ese contenido. ""Si un latino mayor prefiere hablar español y de repente este anuncio está en español, le prestara más atención al punto del anuncio"", dijo Hladek. Ella añadió que estas publicaciones engañosas tienden a tomar un grano de información que puede ser verídica dependiendo del plan médico, con el propósito de confundir a los usuarios. Ella recomienda ser cautelosos antes de darle click a un enlace y dar información personal. Hladek también dijo que es importante no dejarse manipular por las publicaciones que dicen que solo hay pocas horas para recibir beneficios. ""Nunca hay ninguna emergencia en internet que no pueda esperar un día"" Hladek dijo. ""Nunca hay nada que solo puedan obtener durante 24 horas, nunca hay nada que vaya a ser así"". Otros puntos que debes tener en cuenta sobre las flex cards: Solo tu representante de seguro privado puede ofrecerte una flex card, así que no le des click a los videos que prometen hacerte calificar fácilmente.

"Who is Alexander Smirnov, and what does his indictment mean for the GOP impeachment inquiry?","February 26, 2024",Madison Czopek,"Congress, Criminal Justice, Legal Issues","With one arrest, some politicians and pundits speculated that the evidence that President Joe Biden accepted a bribe disappeared. But did it? Tuning into cable news networks, the answer depended on which channel you consulted. On MSNBC, FBI informant Alexander Smirnov’s indictment was characterized as a ""spectacular embarrassment"" to Republicans’ continuing effort to impeach Biden. ""The special counsel, Republican appointee, leading the case against Hunter Biden, who was appointed by Donald Trump now says that that guy — this informant they hung their entire claim on about the bribe — he lied,"" Chris Hayes, host of ""All In,"" said Feb. 15. On Feb. 16, Fox News host Sean Hannity said the informant’s indictment made Democrats ""giddy,"" with Biden and Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., calling for the impeachment inquiry to be dropped. ""There’s a lot to unpack here,"" Hannity said. He described the FBI informant’s story as ""a very, very small part of what is a large body of evidence"" supporting the impeachment inquiry and said. ""None of this negates the fact that Joe Biden lied about his knowledge of his son’s business dealings."" House Republicans have spent years investigating the Biden family’s business dealings and, in 2023, formally launched an impeachment inquiry into Biden. Throughout the investigation, Republicans have characterized Smirnov’s allegations that Biden accepted a $5 million bribe as vice president as central to the impeachment effort. As of Feb. 23, their investigation has produced no evidence that Biden engaged in wrongdoing or accepted a bribe. Who is this informant, and what does it mean for Republicans’ impeachment case? Here’s what we know: Alexander Smirnov became an FBI ""confidential human source,"" or FBI informant, in 2010, according to the indictment. Court filings have revealed little about Smirnov, 43: He previously lived in California and he has lived in Las Vegas since 2022. It is unclear where Smirnov was born. Smirnov was repeatedly told he must provide truthful information to the FBI, but he ""provided false derogatory information to the FBI"" about Biden and his son Hunter, the indictment said. In June 2020, Smirnov claimed that in 2015 or 2016, executives at Burisma — a Ukrainian energy company that once employed Hunter Biden — said they paid $5 million each to Joe Biden and Hunter when Joe Biden was still vice president so that Joe Biden would remove then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin and end a Shokin-led criminal investigation into Burisma. In June, Republicans and Democrats reviewed a redacted form with Smirnov’s allegations and said the FBI had described him as ""highly credible."" At the time, the FBI made clear the allegations were unverified. These bribery allegations were a central part of House Republicans’ continuing impeachment case against Biden. Smirnov’s bribery claims ""were fabrications,"" according to the indictment. Smirnov was indicted on one count of making a false statement to a government agent and one count of falsifying records in a federal investigation, when Smirnov knowingly caused the creation of a false entry on an FBI 1023 form used to document his bribery allegations. The indictment said Smirnov had contact with Burisma executives in 2017, after Biden’s vice presidency ended and after Shokin — who was widely considered corrupt and ineffective — was fired in February 2016. ""In other words, when (Biden) had no ability to influence U.S. policy and when (Shokin) was no longer in office,"" the indictment said. Prosecutors said Smirnov ""transformed his routine and unextraordinary business"" with Burisma executives ""into bribery allegations against Public Official 1, the presumptive nominee of one of the two major political parties for President, after expressing bias against Public Official 1 and his candidacy."" In the indictment, Biden is referred to only as ""Public Official 1"" and his son Hunter is described as ""Business Person 1."" As they asked the court to keep Smirnov detained Feb. 20, prosecutors said Smirnov has ""extensive foreign ties, including, most troublingly and by his own account, contact with foreign intelligence services, including Russian intelligence agencies, and has had such contacts recently."" Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee, brought the charges against Smirnov, who, if convicted, could face 25 years in prison. Hunter Biden joined Burisma’s board in 2014. At the time, his father, then the vice president, publicly represented U.S. policy in Ukraine. Hunter, a lawyer and businessman, had no particular expertise in energy or Ukraine. His Burisma ties were public knowledge in 2014 and have been scrutinized for years. Hunter left Burisma’s board in 2019, when Biden launched his campaign for president.  Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden, talks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 13, 2023. (AP) Smirnov’s allegations that Biden accepted a $5 million bribe while vice president were a key element of Republicans’ Biden investigation. In May, House Republicans subpoenaed the FBI for the record — called an FD-1023 form — that documented Smirnov’s allegations against Biden. FBI agents use FD-1023 forms to record unverified reporting from confidential human sources. Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., chair of the House Oversight Committee that has been investigating the Biden family’s business dealings, told Fox News’ Jesse Watters that the form was ""a very crucial piece of our investigation.""  House Republicans, from left, Oversight and Accountability Committee Chairman James Comer, Rep. Jim Jordan and Rep. Jason Smith make a statement to reporters about their impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden at the Capitol in Washington, Dec. 5, 2023. (AP) In response, Christopher Dunham, an FBI official, wrote that a 1023 form does not ""validate the information, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI."" ""The mere existence of such a document would establish little beyond the fact that a confidential human source provided information and the FBI recorded it,"" Dunham wrote. After Republicans threatened to hold the FBI director in criminal contempt of Congress, the agency in June allowed lawmakers to privately review Smirnov’s statements in the 1023 form. Smirnov’s identity was then unknown. In July, against the FBI’s wishes, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, obtained and released the form. When Republicans announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Biden in September, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy listed Smirnov’s claims among the ""serious and credible allegations"" against Biden. ""Even a trusted FBI informant has alleged a bribe to the Biden family,"" McCarthy said. He also said that eyewitnesses have testified that Biden, as vice president, ""joined on multiple phone calls and had multiple interactions"" that were lucrative for Hunter Biden and Hunter’s associates. McCarthy also cited foreign payments to Biden family members and associates as cause for alarm. The evidence Republicans have provided so far, including during the impeachment inquiry, has not proved Biden engaged in wrongdoing, however. A convoluted maze of financial records released by House Republicans shows that Biden family members and associates received $20 million in payments from sources with ties to foreign countries. About $5 million of that went to Hunter Biden and other Biden family members, with the rest going to Biden family business associates. The bank records show no evidence that any payments went to Joe Biden, who was vice president when some of the payments occurred. In January, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, an Oversight Committee member, told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that the 1023 form documenting Smirnov’s statements was the ""most corroborating evidence"" Republicans had supporting allegations that Biden accepted a multimillion-dollar bribe.  (Internet Archive) After Smirnov’s indictment, Comer said in a statement to PolitiFact that the impeachment inquiry ""is not reliant"" on Smirnov’s claims. Jordan also walked back his earlier statement. ""Bank records don’t lie,"" Comer said, adding that the records show millions of dollars in payments to the Bidens, from people or businesses linked to Russia, China, Romania, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The committee’s four memos of bank records neither claim nor prove that Biden accepted a bribe. Comer said witness testimony shows that ""the Bidens were selling Joe Biden as the brand"" and that ""Biden knew about and participated in his family’s business schemes."" PolitiFact and other news outlets reported that Republicans misconstrued, oversold or misrepresented what they learned from testimony provided by Devon Archer, one of Hunter’s former business associates. Another witness, Tony Bobulinski, has made unproved allegations that Biden was involved in one of his family’s business ventures.  Protesters in the audience wear T-shirts with the face of House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., and the words, ""No Evidence,"" on them as the committee begins an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, Sept. 28, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP) An October poll found that 35% of adults said they believe Biden has acted illegally regarding Hunter’s overseas business dealings, and 33% said he acted unethically, The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research reported. The White House pointed PolitiFact to Biden’s Feb. 16 response to Smirnov’s indictment: ""He is lying,"" Biden said of Smirnov. The impeachment inquiry, ""should be dropped,"" Biden said. ""It’s been an outrageous effort from the beginning."" Raskin and Oversight Committee Democrats called for Republicans to end the inquiry. Raskin said the indictment ""demonstrated how key evidence at the heart of House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry is based on a lie."" With a narrow House majority, Republicans would need nearly all party members to impeach Biden, and GOP lawmakers say they do not have the votes. Even then, to remove Biden, the Democratic-majority Senate would have to vote to convict. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.

No evidence of rising LGBTQ+ violent extremism or 'trans terrorism',"February 26, 2024",Grace Abels,"LGBTQ, Terrorism, Guns","Genesse Ivonne Moreno entered a Houston megachurch on Super Bowl Sunday and began firing an AR-style rifle at worshippers, police said. Investigators were still piecing together details from the violent scene — celebrity pastor Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church — when social media claims focused on the shooter’s gender.

""The Lakewood Church shooter was transgender,"" the popular Libs of TikTok X account posted Feb. 12. ""He went by the name ‘Genesse’ and previously ‘Jeffrey.’"" The post included what appeared to be part of a criminal record listing numerous aliases, some of which were male names. The post has 1.2 million views as of Feb 22. (Screenshot of X post) Some users on X claimed Moreno, 36, was a trans woman; others claimed she was a trans man. Fox News included the detail in a headline, writing in a story that the shooter was ""born as a man."" (Fox News has since changed the headline and story).

A day after the Feb. 11 attack, the Houston Police Department acknowledged reports that Moreno had used the alias Jeffery Escalante, but Cmdr. Christopher Hassig, who leads the police department’s homicide division, said in a press conference that ""through all of our investigation to this point … she has been identified this entire time as female … so we are identifying her as Genesse Moreno, Hispanic female.""

Hassig also said there was a sticker on the weapon that said ""Palestine"" and police uncovered  ""anti-semitic writings"" during their investigation. Moreno died at the scene after exchanging gunfire with two off-duty police officers. Two other people were injured, including Moreno’s 7-year-old son, The Associated Press reported. The claim that Moreno was transgender prompted a flurry of posts from conservative influencers stating that this incident signaled that the LGBTQ+ movement was transforming youth into violent terrorists.

""One thing is VERY clear: the modern LGBTQIA+ movement is radicalizing activists into terrorists, and it’s only getting worse,"" conservative influencer Benny Johnson wrote on X on Feb. 12.   

Libs of TikTok described a ""trans terrorist epidemic"" and wrote on X that ""the LGBTQ movement is turning activists into violent extremists."" A year ago, we examined similar claims following a deadly shooting at a Nashville, Tennessee, school. Extremism and domestic terrorism experts told PolitiFact they knew of no widespread threats of growing radicalization or violence from the trans population.

A year later, the experts’ views remain the same. Experts said data shows far-right extremism — not LGBTQ+ violence — is increasing and outpaces terrorism from other perpetrators. In 2020, the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a nonprofit policy research organization, analyzed 893 terrorist incidents (attempted and foiled) from 1994 to 2020 and found that ""right-wing attacks and plots accounted for the majority of all terrorist incidents in the United States,"" in that period. In 2019, they accounted for almost two-thirds of all incidents, researchers said. The report defined ""right-wing terrorism"" as ""the use or threat of violence by sub-national or non-state entities whose goals may include racial or ethnic supremacy; opposition to government authority; anger at women … and outrage against certain policies, such as abortion."" In 2021, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence reported that ""racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists"" and ""militia violent extremists"" present the most lethal threat. People who are racially or ethnically motivated, it found, are ""most likely to conduct mass-casualty attacks against civilians"" and militia violent extremists typically target law enforcement and government personnel. A database maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, a University of Maryland research center, tracked 3,203 violent and nonviolent extremists from 1948 to 2021 and found they are most often male, young, single and motivated by ""far-right"" ideologies. ""Is there a serious threat by (transgender people) in terms of violence?"" said Victor Asal, a University at Albany political science professor. ""If you compare it to extremist right wingers and all sorts of other extremists, I think the answer is very easy. And the answer is no."" Adam Lankford, a University of Alabama criminology professor, said although many kinds of violent extremism were discussed during a working group he attended at the FBI’s law enforcement training academy, ""there was no concern raised about crimes committed by people based on their gender identity."" Asal said there have been a few examples of violent trans activism. ""But compared to other organizations, and more importantly, compared to other groups, this is infinitesimal,"" he said. Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, said violence against LGBTQ+ people is a greater worry. ""The closest thing that there is to a threat involving the LGBT community is the deeply concerning spike in threats targeting that community,"" Lewis said.

In May 2023, ABC News reported the Department of Homeland Security warned law enforcement agencies that threats of violence against the LGBTQ+ community were increasing. DHS’ website says that ""these threats are increasingly tied to hate groups and domestic violent extremists."" Ideological groups that tend to engage in violence frequently promote anti-LGBTQ+ views, said Mia Bloom, a communications professor and extremism expert at Georgia State University: ""That's the one thing that all the groups have in common."" The Williams Institute, a public policy research group on sexual orientation and gender identity topics at the University of California, Los Angeles, found in 2021 that transgender people are four times likelier to be victims of violent crime than people whose gender aligns with the gender assigned to them at birth. In 2022, the institute found that LGBTQ+ people are nine times likelier than non-LGBTQ+ people to be victims of violent hate crimes, which include those ""motivated by bias,"" that involve hate language or symbols, or ""some confirmation by police as evidence that the incident was a hate crime."" ""Per capita violent trans extremists have to have become the most violent group of people anywhere in the world,"" Donald Trump Jr. wrote in a post sharing the Libs of TikTok post about Moreno. ""The amount of shootings they have completed or attempted likely pales in comparison to any other radical group based on how small a group they are. Can’t be close!"" As evidence of a pattern,  Several social media users posted a list of shootings since 2018 that they claim were committed by people who identified as transgender or nonbinary. ""Colorado Springs shooter: nonbinary (Colorado, 2022) Nashville school shooter: trans (Tennessee, 2023) Aberdeen shooter: trans (Maryland, 2018) Denver school shooter: trans (Colorado, 2019) Iowa school shooter: trans/genderfluid (Iowa, 2024) Lakewood Church shooter: trans (Texas, 2024) The modern LGBTQ+ movement is radicalizing our youth into becoming violent extremists."" posted Libs of TikTok on Feb. 12. State names and years were added by PolitiFact for context. In four of the six cases cited, the perpetrators died in the attack. Determining shooters’ gender identity after they die often involves piecing together clues from social media accounts or conversations the shooters had with friends and family. PolitiFact could not independently confirm that all six shooters identified as transgender or nonbinary. The two who are still alive have confirmed their transgender and nonbinary identities. Two of the four who died following the shootings were transgender, police or friends have said. A third suspect who is now dead has been linked to social media posts and accounts with LGBTQ+ flag emojis, he/they pronouns, and the hashtag ""genderfluid."" And police are identifying Moreno as female. But experts cautioned that the larger context of gun violence and shootings show this list is misleading.

There is no standard for defining and tracking gun violence. Some analyses base it on how many people die during an incident; others include the number of people injured; some track gun violence incidents that unfolded in public. Most databases do not track whether shooters were transgender. The Gun Violence Archive, which collects data on mass shootings in which four or more people were shot and/or killed in a single event, counted 3,399 mass shootings from 2018 to Feb. 15, 2024. The earliest incident in the six shootings social media users cited happened in September 2018 in Aberdeen, Maryland — three people were killed by a 26-year-old whose family members and friends said struggled with mental illness and identified as transgender. Even if all six shooters identified as transgender, that is six out of 3,399 incidents, or 0.17%. Survey data from 2022 estimates transgender adults compose about 0.5% to 1.6% of the nation’s adult population. This is an imperfect calculation. Not all six shootings listed by X users would qualify as a mass shooting under the Gun Violence Archive’s definition because, in the Lakewood Church shooting, fewer than four people were shot. And there may be more mass shooters who would identify as transgender that social media users haven’t cited.

A narrower way to analyze this would be to look at the number of active shooter incidents, in which one or more people are engaged in killing or trying to kill people in a populated area. This way of tracking focuses on location and intent rather than injuries or fatalities. The FBI, which tracks these incidents annually, said there were 206 active shooter incidents from 2018 to 2022, 2023 data has not yet been released. If you take the three of the six shootings that happened from 2018 to 2022 and compare them with active shooting incidents tracked by the FBI, they would make up 1.46% of all incidents. An epidemiological analysis of active and public mass shooters Lankford and others conducted in 2021 found that public mass shooters are most often young and male. Not all mass shooters are motivated by extremist ideology, but they are likelier to be single, unemployed and have previous military experience than the general population, the study said. ""To start worrying that somebody who's trans is going to do mass shootings,"" said Laura Dugan, a human security and sociology professor at Ohio State University, ""that's just not a concern, given the vast number of people who are not trans who do mass shootings."""
"Why the juvenile suspects in the Chiefs parade shooting haven’t been named, unlike Kyle Rittenhouse","February 23, 2024",Sara Swann,"Children, Missouri, Guns","In the aftermath of the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade shooting, some social media users wondered why local authorities and news outlets have not released certain information about the juvenile suspects. One of them was Kyle Rittenhouse, who was 17 when he was arrested in the high-profile fatal shootings of two men during a 2020 protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He was acquitted of charges in 2021. ""I am trying to comprehend why the government was quick to reveal my name after I defended myself, but they still haven’t released the names of the Kansas City shooters,"" Rittenhouse posted Feb. 20 on X. Authorities charged four people, two adults and two minors, in connection with the Feb. 14 shooting in Kansas City, Missouri. Several other social media users besides Rittenhouse saw a double standard between the details released in this shooting — the adult suspects are Black, while the juveniles’ races are unknown — and other high-profile, but noncriminal, incidents involving white minors. They mentioned Nick Sandmann, a high schooler whose encounter with a Native American man went viral in 2019, and Holden Armenta, a 9-year-old who was criticized by the news outlet Deadspin for wearing black and red face paint and a Native American headdress to a 2023 Chiefs game. All of these cases involved different circumstances that determined whether identifying information about the minors was released. For example, Missouri law does not allow for juvenile defendants to be identified, except in more severe criminal cases, while Wisconsin law treats all 17-year-olds as adults in criminal prosecutions. Regardless of whether local authorities release identifying information about minors, four journalism ethics experts told PolitiFact that newsrooms must consider the ethics of publishing such details. The Jackson County Prosecutor’s Office said an argument and gunfire broke out at the Chiefs’ Super Bowl parade, leaving one woman dead and 22 other people, most of them children, injured. Lyndell Mays, 23, and Dominic M. Miller, 18, were arrested on charges of second-degree murder, armed criminal action and unlawful use of a weapon. On Feb. 16, before the adult suspects were publicly identified, Jackson County Family Court said two juveniles were arrested on gun-related and resisting arrest charges. No further details about the juveniles have been released. Juvenile court records are typically not disclosed to the public under Missouri law. ""They shouldn’t have their lives derailed because of one bad decision,"" said Clark Peters, a University of Missouri associate professor specializing in criminal and juvenile justice. The ultimate decision to identify a juvenile suspect in Missouri lies with the juvenile court judge, Peters said. If juveniles are charged with a felony, such as murder, a judge may decide to prosecute them as adults. In this case, a judge may decide to allow identifying information about minors to be publicly released. The two juveniles involved in the Kansas City shooting have not been charged with felonies. The Jackson County Family Court said additional charges were expected as the local police investigation continues, but the court did not say who may be charged or what the charges may be. Rittenhouse claimed he acted in self-defense when shooting three people during a night of protests in Kenosha. In November 2021, a jury found him not guilty on counts of first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree attempted intentional homicide and two counts of first-degree reckless endangerment. Rittenhouse was prosecuted as an adult under Wisconsin law, which requires all 17-year-old criminal defendants to be charged and prosecuted as adults. In adult court, the criminal defendant’s name is publicly released at the time of arrest. In Sandmann’s case, there was no crime. His name rose to national prominence because of a 2019 viral video that showed an encounter between Sandmann, then a Covington Catholic High School student, and a Native American protester. Sandmann sued several news organizations, including The Washington Post, USA Today publisher Gannett Co. and CNN, for damages following media coverage of the event. Sandmann privately settled with The Washington Post and CNN; the lawsuit involving Gannett was dismissed. Armenta also went viral online because of a photo taken of him during a Chiefs football game. Soon after, Deadspin ran a story accusing Armenta — without naming him — of wearing blackface. Deadspin included a photo of Armenta showing only half his face, which was covered in black paint. (The other half not seen in the photo was painted red.) The child’s family is suing Deadspin for defamation. Deadspin has since updated the story to remove the photo and mentions of Armenta. When deciding to name a minor suspect, news organizations should weigh a person’s right to privacy and the public’s right to know, said Kellie Stanfield, an associate professor of broadcast journalism at the University of Missouri. John Watson, an associate professor of communications law and journalism ethics at American University, said this is especially important to prioritize minimizing harm when children are involved. ""The potentially massive and long-term harm to children is probably never ethically justified given that they should not be held to the same standards of publicized accountability as newsworthy adults,"" Watson said. Experts said some of the questions journalists should consider are: Does the public need to know the minor’s identity? Why or why not? Would shielding the minor’s identity lead to public harm? Does releasing the minor’s identity give readers a deeper understanding of the context of the story? ""Each circumstance, obviously, is different and might change what a journalist would ultimately decide to do. But the key thing … is to remind oneself that we are dealing with human beings and not just reporting information,"" said Aly Colón, a media ethics professor at Washington and Lee University. Journalists should also be transparent with the public about this decision-making process, said Kathleen Culver, professor and director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""Oftentimes, newsrooms can be so insular. We’re just having these discussions of ethics among ourselves, rather than inviting people from the outside into the conversation,"" Culver said. ""If you are transparent with your audience about why you make those decisions, it’s going to result in more trust of your organization, not less."""
What is Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde’s stance on abortion?,"February 22, 2024",Hope Karnopp,"Abortion, Elections, Wisconsin","Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde has made his current stance on abortion public: He supports exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, and also thinks voters should decide the issue. Hovde made his position clear when asked by PolitiFact Wisconsin to respond to a radio ad that targeted his stances on abortion, based on comments he made while running for the same office in 2012. Here’s the main claims on Hovde’s abortion stance in the ad, which was launched by A Better Wisconsin Together, a progressive research and communications group: ""Hovde said, ‘I am totally opposed to abortion’ and ‘I’m 100% pro-life.’ And he supported overturning Roe v. Wade,"" says the ad, which began airing Feb. 21, a day after Hovde officially entered the race. The ad also implies that Hovde opposes exceptions for rape and incest, because he’s been backed by Wisconsin Right to Life, a group that tracks its endorsed candidates’ stances on rape and incest. ""With views like that, Hovde could be a crucial vote in favor of a national abortion ban,"" the ad says. We ultimately do not rate the claims in the ad. Hovde’s position has changed since he first ran for U.S. Senate in 2012 and made those claims, and he is just now publicly stating his new position. But let’s dig into the claims for the purposes of this PolitiFact as the race gets started. When asked for backup, A Better Wisconsin Together Communications Director Lucy Ripp sent a memo that details the sources behind each claim in the ad. Let’s tackle the claims one by one. First, the ad claims Hovde said he is ""totally opposed to abortion."" That comment comes from Hovde’s appearance on ""The Jerry Bader Show"" in 2012, when he was running in the Republican primary for Senate. Hovde was asked to address concerns from voters that his charity donated to embryonic stem cell research. ""I am a strong believer in pro-life. I am totally opposed to abortion,"" Hovde told the conservative radio show. He defended donating to research into multiple sclerosis, which he was diagnosed with in 1991, but disputed his money went to embryonic stem cell research. So, the ad is correct in the first aspect: Hovde — albeit in 2012 — said he was ""totally opposed to abortion."" A Better Wisconsin Together says the second claim, that Hovde said he is ""100% pro-life,"" came from the same radio interview. Hovde didn’t say ""100%"" exactly, rather that he is a ""strong believer."" Although that caveat is important, the sentiment is similar enough. Now, for the third claim: Did Hovde say he supports overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court case that guaranteed abortion rights? That claim is based on a WisconsinEye interview with Hovde. That was also in 2012, a full decade before Roe v. Wade was overturned. Hovde did not elaborate on his stance when asked whether he thought Roe v. Wade should be overturned, beyond saying ""yes"" and repeating his answer when asked a second time. So, all of those things, apart from one of the wordings, are things that Hovde did say. But a lot has changed since 2012. Some Wisconsin Republicans have softened their stance on abortion after Democrats mobilized voters on the issue in 2022. Let’s check in with Hovde’s campaign to set the record straight on his stance. Ben Voelkel, a Hovde campaign spokesman, sent a statement from Hovde that shows his position has changed since 2012. Hovde said, ""I believe we need exceptions for cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother."" The ad does not explicitly state that Hovde himself opposes exceptions for rape and incest, but suggests he would because Wisconsin Right to Life has supported him in the past. Wisconsin Right to Life did endorse Eric Hovde in 2012, as well as Tommy Thompson, who eventually won the Republican primary. ""Eric Hovde has indicated strong support for federal right-to-life issues should he be elected,"" the anti-abortion group said. The group said in 2023 that it opposes exceptions for rape and incest, but does support emergency medical exceptions. Here’s the other part of Hovde’s stance. He says, ""It is clear after the Dobbs decision that the people of Wisconsin are the ones who should decide this issue."" Assembly Republicans voted last month to pass a bill asking voters whether Wisconsin should ban abortions after 14 weeks of pregnancy. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., also pushed a referendum that would ask Wisconsin voters: ""At what point does society have the responsibility to protect the life of an unborn child?"" However, neither path looks viable at this point. The first proposal deploys a seldom-used process by which a law passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor can be enacted only with voters' approval, and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers opposes the effort. Johnson's suggestion could be used, under current state law, only as a nonbinding vote — one that would measure public opinion but not change the law. However, both processes don’t look possible at this point. Vos’ move would require Evers’ approval, which he wouldn’t give, and voters could not change the law the way Johnson suggested. A Better Wisconsin Together ad that targets Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde’s stances on abortion says: ""Hovde said, ‘I am totally opposed to abortion’ and ‘I’m 100% pro-life.’ And he supported overturning Roe v. Wade,"" the ad reads. Those three things, except for one slightly off wording, are true. But Hovde said those things more than a decade ago. Now, he says he supports exceptions for rape, incest and the mother’s life. He also favors posing the issue to voters through a referendum."
"Donald Trump presume que él ‘hizo pagar’ a los aliados de la OTAN, pero eso es engañoso","February 21, 2024",Amy Sherman,"National, Foreign Policy, Ukraine, Russia, PolitiFact en Español","El candidato presidencial republicano Donald Trump causó un alarme internacional cuando dijo que él ""alentaría"" a Rusia a hacer lo que quiera a un país miembro de la Organización del Tratado del Atlántico Norte que no pague por defensa colectiva. Trump dijo eso el 10 de febrero en un mitin en Conway, Carolina del Sur, mientras describía una conversación con un líder de un país de la OTAN durante su presidencia. Trump usó la anécdota para decir que él era fuerte con la OTAN y que obtenía resultados. Pero Trump malinterpreto varios hechos sobre la alianza y su record en el proceso. ""Yo los hice pagar"", dijo Trump. Él dijo que la OTAN estaba en quiebra hasta que él llegó y le dijo a todos que tenían que pagar sus facturas, desde ese entonces supuestamente más dinero comenzó a entrar. Un video en Instagram muestra parte del discurso de Trump traducido al español, diciendo, ""Si no pagan a la OTAN, no solo no les protegeremos sino que animamos a Rusia a atarcales"". Este también muestra a Trump con subtítulos diciendo, ""¡Ustedes tienen que pagar sus facturas, y entonces el dinero vino sin parar!"". La publicación fue marcada como parte del esfuerzo de Meta para combatir las noticias falsas y la desinformación en su plataforma. (Lea más sobre nuestra colaboración con Meta, propietaria de Facebook e Instagram). El jefe de la OTAN, líderes europeos y el presidente Joe Biden criticaron los comentarios de Trump. Biden dijo que Trump era muy amigable con el presidente de Rusia Vladimir Putin. Algunos republicanos minimizaron lo que Trump dijo; otros lo criticaron. No podemos verificar si esa conversación sucedió, pero podemos examinar cómo y por qué los gastos de la defensa europea cambiaron bajo Trump (y otros líderes). Primero, una clarificación importante: No hay países con pagos atrasados a la OTAN. Por años, Trump ha malinterpretado el objetivo de gasto para la defensa de cada país como pagos debidos a la alianza. ""Los países quedándose cortos tendrán defensas más débiles de lo que nos gustaría, pero ellos no están morosos"", dijo Stephen Saideman, un profesor en la Norman Paterson School of International Affairs de Carleton University. Muchos países miembros han incrementado su gasto en defensa nacional desde 2014. Pero los líderes europeos probablemente hicieron eso pensando en otro líder, no Trump. ""Si alguna persona es responsable de hacer a los europeos gastar más en defensa, es Vladimir Putin"", escribió Ivo Daalder, presidente del Chicago Council on Foreign Affairs, y un Representante Permanente de Estados Unidos en la OTAN durante parte de la administración de Obama, ""No Donald Trump"". Contactamos a voceros de Trump y no recibimos respuesta. John Bolton, quien era el consejero de seguridad nacional de Trump en el 2018 y ahora critica a Trump, le dijo a The Washington Post que Trump presionó agresivamente a socios de la OTAN a incrementar el gasto militar, ""pero él no dijo nada de defender a nadie contra Rusia"". La OTAN fue creada en 1949 para proveer seguridad colectiva contra la Unión Soviética. La alianza tiene 31 miembros, incluyendo a los Estados Unidos. La alianza acordó que un ataque armado contra uno o más de sus miembros constituiría a un ataque contra todos, y cada miembro tomaría acción, incluyendo el uso de la fuerza armada. Los países en la OTAN no pagan dinero a un presupuesto de defensa en común de la OTAN; cada país determina su propio nivel de gasto militar. En el 2014, luego de que Rusia anexó ilegalmente a Crimea, la cabeza de estado y gobierno de la OTAN acordó en gastar 2% de su  producto interno bruto (PIB) de defensa para el 2024, un objetivo discutido por muchos años. El acuerdo fue aspiracional, no obligatorio. Los países no son morosos si no cumplen ese objetivo. ""Están negándose a cumplir un compromiso, pero no existe un mecanismo para hacerlos cumplir"", dijo Justin Logan, director de defensa y de estudios de políticas exteriores en el Cato Institute. El objetivo de 2% consiste ""en que cada país invierta en su propia defensa para que la alianza en conjunto pueda ser más fuerte, pueda detener o defenderse mejor de varias amenazadas (mayormente Rusia)"", Saideman dijo. La OTAN no estaba en quiebra cuando Trump se volvió presidente en 2017. El gasto de defensa de la OTAN ha incrementado desde el anexo de Crimea del 2014, y el gasto aceleró luego de que Rusia invadiera aún más a Ucrania en 2022, Jeremy Shapiro, director de investigación del European Council on Foreign Relations, le dijo a PolitiFact. Logan dijo que los ataques de Rusia y las declaraciones de Trump afectaron las decisiones de gastos de los aliados. ""El vertiginoso gasto de Polonia, por ejemplo, tiene todo que ver con el miedo a Rusia"", Logan dijo. Polonia incrementó su gasto en defensa como porcentaje del PIB de aproximadamente el 2.4% en 2022 al 3.9% en 2023. A fecha de julio de 2023, la OTAN reportó que 11 miembros cumplieron con la meta del PIB de 2%: Estonia, Finlandia, Grecia, Hungría, Letonia, Lituania, Polonia, Rumania, Eslovaquia, el Reino Unido y los Estados Unidos. El Secretario General de OTAN Jens Stoltenberg dijo el 14 de febrero que él espera que 18 aliados gasten 2% del PIB de defensa en 2024 — un incremento de seis veces desde 2014, cuando solo tres aliados cumplieron el objetivo. ""Políticamente, cumplir el nivel de 2% mantiene a tu país fuera del foco y en un estado general de gracia política"", Logan dijo, ""Es por lo cual muchos países pequeños y vulnerables en el este de Europa lo hacen"". Logan hizo advertencias sobre centrarse en el objetivo del 2% del PIB. El 2% ""de la economía alemana es más que el doble de la economía completa de Estonia"", apuntando al PIB. Muchos de los miembros que están cumpliendo el objetivo — Estonia, Letonia, Lituania y Eslovaquia — no ofrecen un poder militar significativo. ""Francia y Turquía, los cuales no cumplen con el estándar de 2%, tienen mucho más potencia de fuego que la mayoría de esos que cumplen con el estándar"", Logan dijo. Trump está equivocado al decir que esta sola amenaza hizo que los aliados de la OTAN incrementaran sus fondos de defensa. Las administraciones de Barack Obama y Biden también pidieron un incremento en el gasto de defensa europeo. ""Es imposible saber si las amenazas de Trump tuvieron más impacto que las apelaciones de solidaridad de Obama y Biden"", Shapiro dijo. Biden y oficiales de alto rango en su administración han apoyado el objetivo de 2%. Cada presidente estadounidense desde Harry S. Truman urgió a los aliados europeos a hacer más, Daalder escribió, añadiendo que Trump no fue el primero ni será el último.

"‘So, who’s right?’ PolitiFact reader feedback on immigration, fact-checking Trump","February 21, 2024",Josie Hollingsworth,"Immigration, National, Ask PolitiFact","PolitiFact readers started 2024 with deep reading and thoughtful comments to our newsroom. They sounded off in emails to reporters and through social media comments about immigration, our fact-checking of former President Donald Trump and a debunk of the cemetery mail truck hoax. Below, our readers’ thoughts, lightly edited for length, clarity and style. Readers can email us fact-check ideas and feedback at [email protected]. Learn more about PolitiFact’s process, and how we’re working to make our fact-checking more transparent. The reader who requested our piece ""Ask PolitiFact: What branch of government is ‘really’ responsible for the crisis at the border?"" wrote in to thank PolitiFact, and immigration reporter Maria Ramirez Uribe: ""Thank you for your response. I really appreciate the thoroughness of your report although Immigration is clearly a muddled mess from any angle. However, I feel you answered my question and I’m sticking to my original idea that Congress should bear a larger portion of the blame for not doing their job over the last 30 years, thereby making it more difficult for the other two branches to work the way they should. Thanks again. I really am grateful for your great reporting!"" One reader thought the question in our piece was pedantic. ""So, who’s right? Is there more Biden can do? Or is it on Congress to update immigration law, which hasn’t been changed in decades?"" So what if it hasn’t ‘changed in decades’?  Existing law gives him the power to protect our borders for crying out loud.  That’s why he reversed Trump’s policies … to create the invasion.  And he has certainly succeeded in doing that. Let me ask … if someone is seeking asylum from say, Gaza, why must they seek it in the United States?  Or if they are from Venezuela, why don’t they seek asylum in the very first country they cross the border into? Come on."" Another reader followed up about the framing of the immigration piece: ""What if the question was asked differently: A proactive action by which arm of government would have the most impact? Is the Executive branch able to perform an action(s) that would make a big improvement in immigration outcomes? Or would a proactive action by the courts make the bigger improvement (a nonstarter, courts are reactive, not proactive)? Or would a proactive action by the Congress, if they chose to do it) make the biggest improvement at the border? Personally, I think the ability to create the biggest improvement (at) the border lies with Congress. Thank you for your article."" Social media users (and a former president of the United States) have falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of ballots were sent to dead people — and pets — in Virginia and Nevada. As evidence, these posts often share the same photo of a mail truck in a cemetery; some claim Democrats have something to do with it. It’s possible to view these social media posts — many with laughing emojis — as a joke, which is why we didn’t fact-check these claims on our Truth-O-Meter. However, these posts spread the falsehood that U.S. elections are marred by widespread fraud. Some readers thought we simply couldn’t take a joke. ""The mail truck in the cemetery is a joke and doesn’t say Republican Democrat. So you need to get a sense of humor. It’s (a) joke."" ""It is just a joke intended for those who have a sense of humor."" We heard from the original poster of the Facebook post: ""You fact-checked my sharing on FB of the above post. I am very amused at your action on this post. Evidently you have never heard of sarcasm or satire. Just to be helpful, satire is defined as the use of exaggeration, humor, or irony to criticize someone. ""Well, congratulations on stopping the distribution of a good joke. But do not ever try to convince anyone you are an impartial arbiter. You are a radical, left-wing propagandist using fact-checking to reduce free speech of your political opponents. It is evident you do not follow the famous quote, ‘I detest what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.’ I hope you never have to live under a regime that you are helping to build."" A reader wrote to us on Threads about the Trump food prices inflation check: ""By the way, you forgot to point out that higher prices (are) a trailing indicator of inflation (i.e., a rapid increase of the money supply). Remember when Trump said he liked ""a weak dollar"" (an old mercantilist idea)? How do you think you weaken the dollar? Blaming Biden for inflation Trump caused is the most grotesque show of chutzpah one can imagine."" On our look into our 1,000 fact-checks of Donald Trump, one reader asked: ""Does this matter really? So, he said false facts. Talk is cheap. Actions are what matter. Would you rather have someone that speaks the truth all the time and their actions say otherwise or vice versa?"" And a general comment: ""I am getting tired of hearing about Donald Trump and his problems. It's getting really old."" We also have a few comments from supporters that show the value of our fact-checking reporting: ""Just going to guess that if there were no Trump, PolitiFact would just continue to independently fact check political statements from both sides of the aisle. You know, like they did before Trump (see: Obama-meter). There’s a section on their website dedicated to their process, their ethics policy, their funding and disclosures, how they correct their mistakes, etc., if you’re actually curious about evaluating the accuracy and trustworthiness of this particular source. I hope you’ll check it out, and also generate the same level of curiosity about other news sources you may use which likely don’t have nearly the same level of ethical commitment."" ""I appreciate how you cite your research and get multiple sources in each story."" ""I wish more news media would adhere to a high standard like this. It's too much of a ratings game instead of delivering facts with some depth to a story. Thank you for your efforts!"" ""I like the easy-to-read fact/evidence-based reviews of assertions made by individuals. I may not agree with the ultimate conclusion you assign, but because you include all the information in your review, I can make up my own mind. The work is excellent."" And simply:

""PolitiFact is a clear voice in a wilderness of demons."" We are happy to stand out as helpful in the wild world of false. If you are interested in this type of behind-the-scenes fact-checking, consider signing up for the daily or weekly email newsletter from PolitiFact.

Will Michelle Obama run for president? All signs point to no,"February 20, 2024",Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu,Elections,"Could Michelle Obama be making a comeback to the White House — this time as president? For years, conservative media has peddled the notion that the former first lady has presidential ambitions. As recent concerns about President Joe Biden’s age and fitness for office have grown and the November election nears, the rumor mill is back in action. The theory suggests Biden will drop out or be forced out of the race and Michelle Obama will replace him as the Democratic Party’s 2024 presidential nominee. The claims have gained prominence as pundits, leading politicians and podcast hosts amplify them. The theory has roots in conspiracy theories about the Deep State. On Feb. 9, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick posted on X, ""I’ve said for over a year many times that Joe Biden would not be on the ticket and Michelle Obama would be the likely nominee. It’s clear the Democrat deep state run by Barack Obama knew they had to take him down to give them a chance in November."" Patrick posted the comments a day after Special Counsel Robert Hur released a report about Biden’s handling of classified documents and portrayed Biden as having a faulty memory, a potentially politically damaging characterization in a reelection year. Conservative activist Benny Johnson also described the Obama theory during a Jan. 9 episode of his show with guest Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. ""There is a trend going around, a lot of whispers, that Joe Biden is there to survive through the primary season,"" Johnson said. ""So, there is no primary for the Democrats and nobody has a chance to run against Michelle Obama and nobody has a chance to actually run against whoever they have chosen. Then, then, you do the switcheroo in the spring."" Greene responded, ""I think it is very possible."" She also called Biden’s presidency ""(Barack) Obama’s third term"" and said of the former first lady: ""She owns Joe Biden’s policies. She owns the Biden administration. She owns the failure. She owns the Green New Deal. She owns the inflation. She owns the wide-open border."" PolitiFact contacted Michelle Obama’s office. Her spokesperson declined to comment and referred us to recent news articles that show Michelle Obama dispelling the theory. Since 2012, Michelle Obama has repeatedly denied rumors that she will run for the presidency.  No publicly available information supports the claim that she will run for president. Keneshia Grant, a Howard University associate political science professor, said Michelle Obama might be a target of this speculation because of partisan political panic. ""It might be that people who have this worry would like for Trump to win, and they are trying to think about maybe the one person who might be able to beat Donald Trump,"" she said, ""and they think that this is the one person who could do it."" Greene and Texas’ Patrick were the most recent in a line of current and former politicians and political candidates making similar comments: Last September, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speculated, ""In August of 2024, the Democrat kingmakers (will) jettison Joe Biden and parachute in Michelle Obama."" Sarah Palin, former Republican vice presidential nominee and former Alaska governor, wrote on X last September, ""Don’t be surprised. But I still say it’ll be Michelle O’ #2024Election. Biden’s out."" Speaking on Fox News this month after the release of Hur’s report, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said, ""I do think what they are planning for is to sideline Biden as the nominee, trod in a different puppet. Which is what leads me to the likely conclusion that it is going to be someone like Michelle Obama."" No one making the claim has presented any evidence to support it. And Biden has rebutted notions that he’s unable to continue in the job. Some social media claims go even further, invoking the longstanding, racially charged conspiracy theory that Michelle Obama is a man and would be the first transgender nominee or president. When Barack Obama posted Feb. 14 on X wishing Michelle a happy Valentine’s Day, one person responded, ""Raise your hand if you think Michelle should run for president!"" with a meme that said ""Michelle Obama ‘24."" In response to the meme, another person wrote, ""Oh, I think its fantastic idea. First fully (diversity, equity and inclusion) president. Black, gay AND trans!!"" When a student asked in 2012 whether Michelle Obama would consider running for president, she said ""absolutely not."" ""One of the things you learn about yourself as you get older are what are your strengths and what are your interests, and for me, it’s other stuff, that is not being the president,"" Obama said. In 2016, as speculation grew again, then-President Barack Obama dismissed the notion that  his wife would take over the White House. ""Let me tell you, there are three things that are certain in life. Death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president."" In 2017, Michelle Obama dismissed the speculation: ""I wouldn't ask my children to do this again, because when you run for higher office, it's not just you. It's your whole family."" In 2022, when asked in a BBC interview whether there is any question she detests, Obama said there was. It’s, ""Are you going to run for president?"" ""No I am not,"" she said. In 2023, she told Oprah Winfrey (who has also repeatedly denied rumors about running for president), ""I have never expressed any interest in politics. Ever."" As the recent rumors surfaced, David Alexrod, a close friend of the Obamas, told CNN, ""She is not someone who likes politics … I have as much chance of dancing in the Bolshoi Ballet next year."" As first lady, Michelle Obama was highly visible to voters but sat outside the divisive partisan environment. This afforded her a unique national name recognition and popularity among voters. ""That she is not a politician is exactly why she is popular,"" Howard University’s Grant said. ""She is a person who we know, a person who we trust but a person who doesn't have the baggage of previous political statements or political decisions."" In a January interview with podcast host Jay Shetty, Obama said she was ""terrified"" about the upcoming 2024 election and what it could mean for democracy as Donald Trump appears to be closing in on the GOP nomination. But Obama did not say she was motivated to run for office. Even if Michelle Obama were to express interest in the presidency, many other logistical things would have to fall into place for her candidacy to become a reality — such as the Democratic ticket having a vacancy. If there is a vacancy prior to the August Democratic convention in Chicago, the delegates Biden has amassed during the primaries could decide to give their votes to a candidate whose political philosophy is similar to Biden’s. For that candidate to be Michelle Obama, that would mean she would have to declare an interest in being chosen. Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, Biden’s remaining Democratic challenger, could make a pitch to delegates to back him instead. If the vacancy occurs between the convention and election day, the Democratic National Committee has the power to name a presidential nominee — likely (but not mandated) to be Biden’s running mate Kamala Harris. The chairperson of the DNC, Jaime Harrison, was selected for the job by Biden. If Harris were elevated to the presidential slot, the DNC would also name a vice presidential nominee.

A poll found 1 in 5 believe in covert Taylor Swift effort to help Biden win. What does that mean?,"February 20, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"Elections, Fake news, Polls and Public Opinion","A January Fox News segment promoted the bubbling conspiracy theory that singer-songwriter Taylor Swift is a government operative whose mission is bolstering President Joe Biden’s reelection chances. Now a poll shows a significant percentage of Americans are buying the false claim. Monmouth University Polling Institute’s mid-February survey of 902 adults found that nearly 1 in 5 Americans believed the Swift-psyop theory. The telephone polling overlapped with the Feb. 11 Super Bowl in Las Vegas, which Swift attended to watch her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce. ""Even many who hadn’t heard about it before we polled them accept the idea as credible,"" Patrick Murray, the Monmouth pollster who directed the survey, said in an announcement about the poll results. It has ""legs among a decent number of Trump supporters."" The poll results drew significant media attention. But as fact-checkers, we had questions. How meaningful is any poll when asking about a conspiracy theory? How much room do poll respondents have to fill in the blanks about how far the conspiracy stretches? And could support for the theory simply be standing in for disdain for Biden, Swift or both? In January, The New York Times reported that unnamed Biden aides were dreaming of a Swift endorsement. (Swift endorsed Biden in 2020.) But there is no evidence that Biden or his allies are manipulating government resources to produce a renewed endorsement this year. ""A lot more research would have to be done to tease apart all of the contributors to support for the Swift covert ops conspiracy,"" said Jesse H. Rhodes, a University of Massachusetts-Amherst political scientist and co-director of the UMass poll. ""I think the main point is that there are many contributors to apparent support for this conspiracy, and not all of them reflect genuine, heartfelt endorsement of the conspiracy (theory) itself."" In the Monmouth poll, respondents were asked whether they had heard of Swift (only 5% had not) and, if so, whether they viewed her favorably or unfavorably (39% favorable, 13% unfavorable and the balance no opinion). The poll also asked whether they considered themselves hard-core ""Swifties"" (only 6%). Respondents were also asked their view on Swift encouraging people to vote in the presidential election (68% approved). Later in the poll, 46% of respondents said they had heard of the theory that Swift is part of a covert government effort to help Joe Biden win. Then the pollsters asked, ""Do you think that a covert government effort for Taylor Swift to help Joe Biden win the presidential election actually exists, or not?"" The poll did not define that alleged ""covert government effort"" and did not ask respondents follow-up questions that would clarify their views about such theory. About 1 in 5 – 18% – said yes. About 71% of those who believed this identify with or lean toward the Republican Party and 83% said they are likely to support Donald Trump in the fall, the polling institute said. The poll had a sampling margin of error of about plus or minus 4 percentage points, meaning that results like the 18% figure could be from four points lower to four points higher. Paradoxically, 42% of poll respondents who said the conspiracy exists also said they had not heard about it before Monmouth’s pollsters asked them about it. Previous polling has shown that a nontrivial segment of the American public believes in conspiracy theories. Monmouth polling from 2018 found that a majority said the ""Deep State,"" a purported group of unelected government and military officials who secretly direct or manipulate national policy, ""probably"" or ""definitely"" exists. In 2010, PolitiFact gave a Pants on Fire to the claim supported by 18% of the population, that then-President Barack Obama was Muslim, a finding a Pew Research Center poll had recently recorded. Murray said that, in any polling, some respondents give an answer that ""aligns with a pre-existing attitudinal pattern."" However, the Swift psyop theory offers especially strong evidence of that. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents who had preexisting knowledge of the story, Murray said, 42% said the conspiracy exists. Also, nearly three-quarters (73%) of poll respondents who said they believed the theory about Swift also said they believed the 2020 election outcome was fraudulent. PolitiFact has repeatedly debunked statements that the 2020 election was stolen or rigged or that Biden’s win was illegitimate. ""There always seems to be a segment of the public that believes in conspiracy theories,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. ""I’ve always wondered if people who answer these questions are true believers, soft believers, or are just teasing the pollsters. We don’t know how deeply people hold these beliefs."" In a 2013 article, Bowman wrote that substantial survey data signaled that ""skepticism about the federal government’s power and reach is deep. It seems that whenever pollsters use the words ‘government’ and ‘cover-up,’ a substantial number respond in the affirmative."" The University of Massachusetts’ Rhodes agreed that suspicions of the federal government are widespread, pointing to persistent conspiracy theories about President John F. Kennedy’s assassination and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""The Swift covert op conspiracy shares characteristics of other conspiracy theories in that it features a narrative of powerful actors using shadowy methods to shape politics and manipulate the public,"" Rhodes said. ""Because the Swift conspiracy partakes of narrative forms common to conspiracy theories in general, people who tend to believe in conspiracy theories might gravitate to this one."" Rhodes suggested that some respondents may not believe the conspiracy theory’s specifics but said they agreed with it because they distrust the government or dislike Biden or Swift. ""This conspiracy theory is a way of expressing negative sentiment toward Biden, Swift, the federal government, or all of the above,"" said Rhodes, who said social scientists call this phenomenon ""expressive responding.’ Other poll respondents could have said they believe the theory because they were reacting to a sentiment shared on conservative media that coverage of Swift and Kelce shifted the Super Bowl focus away from football. ""There are many contributors to apparent support for this conspiracy, and not all of them reflect genuine, heartfelt endorsement of the conspiracy itself,"" Rhodes said. Also playing into support for the Swift conspiracy theory could be sentiment that celebrities should stay out of politics, Bowman said. A recent Economist/YouGov poll showed that 48% of respondents want Taylor Swift to not speak publicly about politics.

What happens if Joe Biden or Donald Trump leaves his party’s ticket?,"February 20, 2024",Marta Campabadal Graus,"National, Elections","The available evidence suggests Joe Biden and Donald Trump will face each other for the presidency in November. They are 81 and 77 years old, respectively. Trump is facing up to four criminal trials that could theoretically land him in prison. Also, some states are trying to keep Trump off their ballots for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, although the Supreme Court seems unlikely to let the states do that. So, what happens if one of the major party’s presidential tickets opens up before inauguration day? It depends heavily on timing. ""The process to replace a nominee, presumptive or otherwise, gets less messy the closer it gets to the convention,"" said Josh Putnam, a political scientist specializing in delegate selection rules and founder of the political consulting company FHQ Strategies LLC. The Republican convention is scheduled for Milwaukee in mid-July; the Democratic convention is slated for Chicago in late August. Complicating matters for the Republicans is that Trump’s trial schedules are in flux, except for the New York trial over alleged hush-money payments to adult film actor Stormy Daniels, which is set to begin March 25. Here’s a rundown of potential scenarios. Democratic nominee Dean Phillips? Not so fast. (Louis Jacobson/PolitiFact) The primary process has started for both parties. Most states have a primary to allocate delegates to each party’s national convention, at which the presidential nominee is formally selected. In a few states, parties opt instead for caucuses, which are typically in-person gatherings rather than ballots cast at polling places or through the mail. So far, only a few states have allocated delegates. Officially, the primaries run through June, although the single biggest haul of delegates, a collection of contests known as Super Tuesday, will run March 5. One candidate from each party could have enough delegates to mathematically seal their nominations by the end of March. Neither Biden nor Trump has the field to themselves yet. The most prominent opponent Biden faces is Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota; Trump continues to spar with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Nevertheless, Biden and Trump are considered overwhelming favorites to secure their parties’ nominations. For both parties’ candidates, amassing delegates now helps secure their power and, if they are off the ticket, their legacy. ""Trump is attempting to get through all of the primary season in order to snatch up as many delegates as possible to buttress his case against being replaced,"" Putnam said. ""The more delegate slots a candidate like Biden or Trump is able to fill lends some certainty to who the delegates who will vote on a nominee at the national convention will be."" Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 7 in Big Bend, Wis., on Jan. 22, 2024. (AP) After the primary season is effectively over and before the the party conventions finish, delegates would play the decisive role if a nominee leaves the ticket. All told, the Republicans will have about 2,400 delegates; the Democrats will have around 4,700. The GOP will meet July 15-18; the Democrats will meet Aug. 19-22. If Biden or Trump couldn’t proceed with the nomination during the pre-convention period, candidates left standing, such as Haley for the Republicans, could argue that their second-place finish justifies making them the nominee. But this argument would hardly be a slam dunk, because the delegates allocated during the primary process could choose someone else with wider support within the party. ""Trump-selected delegates are likely to settle on someone in the Trump vein, rather than someone like Mitt Romney or Nikki Haley,"" Putnam said. ""A lively debate could take place among those vying for the nomination at the convention, but it may occur in a narrow ideological band."" Similarly, the delegates Biden collected and appointed would likelier back a Biden-style establishment Democratic nominee than a more liberal option. This is especially true because a portion of Democratic delegates are known as ""superdelegates"" who earn their status from holding an elected or appointed position within the party. Historically, superdelegates are assumed to prefer establishment candidates rather than insurgents. Biden could amass the majority of delegates and then, on the eve of the convention, forgo running and urge his delegates to vote for a candidate he chooses or follow their consciences. Any vacancy that leaves an unsettled convention, rather than one that’s carefully choreographed, as has been standard in recent decades, could become a political show for the ages, with furious backroom lobbying to secure delegate support. If Biden were to die in office (or be made to relinquish the presidency because of incapacity under the 25th Amendment), Vice President Kamala Harris would become the incumbent president. In this scenario, it would be hard to envision Democratic delegates blocking her from the nomination, but it’s possible. Vice Presidential candidate Sargent Shriver with Sen. Thomas Eagleton, the man he replaced on the Democratic ticket, on Sept. 7, 1972 at St. Louis airport. (AP) If Biden or Trump were approved as the nominee at the convention but had to leave the ticket before Election Day, the parties would follow different rules. On the Democratic side, the rules empower the Democratic National Committee to name a replacement. The Democrats would not have to name the vice presidential running mate as the replacement atop the ticket, but it would be considered the most likely option. That would make Harris the nominee, assuming she wanted to. If Harris were elevated, the same process would determine the new vice presidential nominee. This happened in 1972, when the DNC named Sargent Shriver as the vice presidential nominee after Missouri Sen. Thomas Eagleton left the ticket following revelations about his mental health. The Republican rules are murkier. A reconvening of the national convention is possible, but the Republican National Committee could probably find an alternative mechanism, Putnam said. Regardless, ""it would not be as clean or as clear a move as the process on the Democratic side,"" Putnam said. An additional complication for both parties is that delegates are allocated by primary and caucus results, but the candidate who wins them still must officially name the people to fill those delegate slots. That takes time and it’s possible that not all delegate slots would be filled by the time a nominee changed suddenly. ""State parties would be empowered to name those delegates in the absence of the two likely nominees,"" Putnam said. ""That arguably could lead to a more chaotic national convention."" The completion of delegate selection with a convention of mostly Biden or Trump delegates ""would tamp down on some of the crazier or messier outcomes,"" he said. President Gerald Ford congratulates newly confirmed Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, right, after he was sworn-in on the Senate floor on Dec. 19, 1974. (AP) If a new president is elected but dies before inauguration, the duly elected vice president would become the next president. A new vice president to serve alongside the newly elevated president would need to be approved by the Senate and the House, as happened when Congress approved Nelson Rockefeller after Gerald Ford took over for Richard Nixon, who had resigned amid the Watergate scandal. In the case of an incumbent president who won another term, such as Biden if he wins this fall, Harris would become president immediately because she is an incumbent, too. There’s still room for more wackiness. According to The Washington Post, if the winner dies between when the electoral votes are cast and when Congress counts them Jan. 6, 2025, it’s not entirely clear what would happen, even for the National Archives and Records Administration, whose job it is to know. ""We don’t know what would happen"" in that scenario, the agency says on its website."
Did a Florida school district send permission slips to teach kids Black history? Here are the facts,"February 16, 2024",Samantha Putterman,"Education, Race and Ethnicity, Florida","When Chuck Walter saw the permission slip from his daughter’s Miami school, he turned to social media. Sharing an image of a form that requested parental signature for his first grader to attend a 30-minute ""read-aloud"" activity in which she would hear a ""book by an African American author,"" Walter aired his disbelief. ""I had to give permission for this or else my child would not participate???"" Walter wrote Feb. 12 on X. The image showed that the library event would involve guests — ""fireman/doctor/artist,"" it read. Walter told NBC News that he gave the Coral Way K-8 Center teacher ""verbal consent"" for the Black History Month activity but was told that the form must be signed or his child could not participate. The image sparked outcry. And soon Florida Education Commissioner Manny Diaz, Jr., responded on X calling news of the permission slip a ""hoax."" ""Florida does not require a permission slip to teach African American history or to celebrate Black History Month,"" Diaz wrote Feb. 13. ""Any school that does this is completely in the wrong."" Florida Department of Education spokesperson Cailey Myers also told PolitiFact that permission slips are not required for students to receive ""ordinary instruction, like African American History, in Florida."" Education leaders did not answer our questions about what book was being read during the event. So, what happened here? The incident appears to have arisen out of confusion over the Parental Rights in Education law, signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022 and expanded in 2023. The legislation bans classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in all public schools through 12th grade. The law's supporters say it gives greater parental control over children’s education; critics have dubbed it the ""Don’t Say Gay"" law. One rule in the new law, 6A-10.085, requires schools to seek parental consent before children can participate in ""field trips, extracurricular activities and supplemental programs."" It doesn’t say that teaching any particular subject, including Black history, requires permission. The local district in late November implemented its permission slip policy to comply with the rule. The policy requires parental consent for extracurricular activities, including guest speakers, tutoring sessions and school dances. Miami-Dade County Public Schools spokesperson Elmo Lugo said in an email to PolitiFact that the event’s description ""may have caused confusion,"" but said the district is working with schools to emphasize the importance of clearly stating what kinds of events require permission. In this case, Lugo said, the permission slip was sent home ""because guest speakers would participate during a school-authorized education-related activity,"" not because it involved a Black author. The state’s education department didn’t respond to PolitiFact’s questions about whether it believes the school district was interpreting the law correctly. In an undated letter addressed to Coral Way’s principal, Florida Board of Education Chair Ben Gibson characterized the state’s policy as a way to ""keep parents informed of the extracurricular activities their children are participating in"" and said it appeared Coral Way had misinterpreted this as applying to ""ordinary instruction.""

""This should be obvious on its face, and therefore, those providing guidance to you and your school are either grossly misinterpreting the rule or simply engaged in nothing more than a political ploy,"" Gibson wrote, according to a copy of the letter that the Department of Education shared with PolitiFact. Both before and after Walter’s X post, Miami-Dade school board members questioned how the rule was being executed and asked administrative staff to ask the state to clarify how to properly apply the rule. ""There's no permission slip to teach Black history,"" board member Steve Gallon III said during a Feb. 13 meeting. ""And that's the narrative that's been formulated that I think we have to be bold and transparent and open about clarifying and debunking as much as we can."" Teaching African American history is required by state statute and Miami-Dade schools comply with that throughout the year, the district’s chief academic officer, Lourdes Diaz, said in the meeting. ""For teachers to convey curriculum to students in the classroom — that is instruction — but activities that are sponsored by the school, created for students to study or participate in that are outside of that would require a permission form,"" Diaz told school board members. ""But the instruction of a required topic, be it Black history, Holocaust education, women's history, all the other ones, does not require a form, per se.""

What do articles of impeachment say Alejandro Mayorkas did or didn’t do?,"February 16, 2024",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"Immigration, Border Security, Legal Issues","In the historic Feb. 13 impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas, House Republicans said the Homeland Security secretary ""willfully and systematically refused to comply with immigration laws"" and ""breached public trust"" by falsely telling Congress the U.S.-Mexico border was secure. This is the second time in U.S. history that a Cabinet member has been impeached; the first was in 1876, when Secretary of War William Belknap was impeached for corrupt kickbacks. We reviewed what the articles of impeachment say Mayorkas did or did not do and found the articles misconstrued what is possible under immigration law and congressional appropriations. Constitutional scholars, former Homeland Security secretaries and immigration experts have criticized the impeachment, saying the articles cite policy disagreements rather than impeachable offenses, which include ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" House Republicans said Mayorkas ""willfully and systematically"" refused to comply with the law by refusing to enforce a detention mandate. This charge lacks context about the federal government’s capacity to detain migrants who cross the southern U.S. border. Federal immigration law generally requires that people who enter the U.S. illegally be detained while they await court proceedings. Immigrant detention can involve multiple federal agencies. People who are apprehended at the border are temporarily taken into custody by Border Patrol agents as they decide next steps. Some people are transferred from temporary border holding facilities to detention centers across the country operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But there’s not enough detention space for the large number of migrants who cross the southern border. ""Due to consistent and significant funding shortfalls … DHS has never had ‘sufficient detention capacity to maintain in custody every single person,’"" U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a 2022 opinion about the program known as ""Remain in Mexico."" In fiscal year 2023, Congress allocated money for immigration authorities to detain 34,000 people. That year, Immigration officials encountered migrants 3.2 million times — a number that represents events, not people. If one person tries to enter the country three times and is stopped each time by border officials, for example, that equals three encounters, even if it’s the same person encountered. Although immigration law requires that people be detained, courts have long debated whether people can be indefinitely detained, according to the Congressional Research Service. Mounting backlogs of millions of immigration cases mean that court proceedings can take years to resolve. And not every country will accept its nationals who have been deported from the U.S. So, even if there were enough detention space, there likely would be legal challenges to holding people for extended periods. The impeachment articles also said, ""Mayorkas knowingly made false statements to Congress that the border is ‘secure’ … and that DHS has ‘operational control’ of the border."" The missing context is that given the legal definition of operational control, no administration has ever achieved it. Operational control is a legal term that was defined by Congress in the 2006 Secure Fence Act. The law tasks DHS with preventing all illegal entries into the U.S., including ""terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband."" During an April 2022 House committee hearing, Republicans questioned Mayorkas about whether he had ""operational control"" of the border. ""Will you testify under oath right now? Do we have operational control, yes or no?"" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, asked Mayorkas during the 2022 hearing. ""Yes, we do,"" Mayorkas responded. Roy read the 2006 legal definition of operational control and asked, ""Do you stand by your testimony that we have operational control in light of this definition?"" ""I do, and Congressman, I think the Secretary of Homeland Security would have said the same thing in 2020 and in 2019,"" Mayorkas responded. Roy switched discussion topics before Mayorkas could elaborate. In March 2023, U.S. Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz told a House committee that the Biden administration did not have ""operational control"" over the southern border. Soon after, Senate Republicans pressed Mayorkas to assess the issue again. ""Do we or don’t we"" have operational control, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Mayorkas. Mayorkas said when gauging operational control, he does ""not use the definition that appears in the Secure Fence Act."" ""So, the way I define it is maximizing the resources that we have to deliver the most effective results, and we are indeed doing that,"" Mayorkas said. House Republicans said Mayorkas ""breached the public trust"" by refusing ""to control and guard the boundaries and borders of the United States against the illegal entry of aliens."" As evidence, the articles of impeachment cite Mayorkas’ termination of Migrant Protection Protocols. The Trump-era program, also known as ""Remain in Mexico,"" sent some migrants seeking asylum back to Mexico to await immigration court proceedings. Mayorkas ended the program. However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that ending it did not violate immigration law. House Republicans cited a lower court’s ruling forcing Biden to restart the program as evidence that Mayorkas failed to fulfill his duty to secure the border, and that ending the program increased illegal immigration. But the impeachment articles don’t acknowledge the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the program to end. Also, the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute has raised doubts about the program’s effectiveness at lowering illegal immigration.

Sorting out what Marco Rubio said about Senate immigration bill’s ‘asylum corps’,"February 16, 2024",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"Immigration, Border Security","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who has led attempts to update immigration law, this month rejected a bill that would have given immigration officials more funding and changed how asylum is decided for people arriving at the U.S.’ southwest border. Rubio justified his decision in a Feb. 11 CNN interview, saying the bill would have led to the hiring of bureaucrats who would easily let people into the country to give them work permits or asylum and a path to citizenship. ""The bill basically creates an asylum corps … thousands of bureaucrats, asylum agents that would be empowered right at the border to either allow people into the country with an immediate work permit,"" Rubio said. ""Or they have the power to immediately release them and grant them asylum."" The bill, which failed in the Senate on a 49-50 vote, sought to hire more asylum officers. But Rubio omits that these officers are already part of the immigration system. Currently, they decide the cases of people who already live in the United States and are not in deportation proceedings. The Senate bill wanted to enable these officials to also decide the cases of new southwest border arrivals who would have applied for asylum as a defense against deportation. Immigration experts questioned Rubio’s characterization that the bill would have made it easier for people to get asylum. PolitiFact emailed Rubio’s press office for comments but did not hear back. Although this bill is no longer being considered, asylum law and policies remain major contention points within Congress and in its negotiations with the Biden administration. So, here’s an analysis of the asylum provisions of this bill, which could influence future legislation. There’s a backlog of millions of asylum cases that immigration judges and asylum officers must decide. That amount of cases is pending largely because of the high numbers of people applying and the low number of resources available to adjudicate these applications. The border bill sought to shorten the asylum decision process from years to six months and to expedite the issuing of work permits to eligible migrants. The bill also tried to make it harder to get asylum by raising the initial screening standard and adding new eligibility criteria (if people could move within their own home country to avoid persecution, they wouldn’t be eligible for asylum in the United States.) The bill would have funded the hiring of thousands of new asylum officers who work for the executive branch, specifically the Department of Homeland Security. But asylum officers have been deciding cases for a long time within DHS’ U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a Migration Policy Institute policy analyst. USCIS handles cases of people who are already in the United States, not necessarily people who are newly arriving at U.S. borders. Rubio in 2013 co-sponsored a bill that would have enabled asylum officers ""under certain circumstances"" to grant asylum to people arriving at the border, according to the Congressional Research Service. Immigration judges, who Rubio suggested he preferred, also are employed by the executive branch, specifically the Justice Department. Both asylum officers and immigration judges receive extensive training on immigration laws, said Bush-Joseph. Asylum officers would have had the power to decide the cases of people arriving at U.S. borders. This responsibility has rested only with immigration judges. Also, a newly created board of asylum officers would review case appeals. Currently, immigration courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals (a group of 23 appellate immigration judges within the Justice Department) have this responsibility. Under the bill, people arriving at the border who seek asylum would have been released from custody and monitored remotely by immigration officials. Asylum officers would then have had 90 days to interview them and to decide whether there is a ""reasonable possibility"" that the person is eligible for asylum. People who passed that initial interview could become eligible for work permits and be referred for another asylum interview. Asylum officers would also have been able to conduct a second interview within 90 days. This is where immigration courts usually step in. The officers’ supervisors would review decisions to give people asylum after the second interview. There would also be another way to get asylum. During the first interview, if people proved an even higher standard, that they had ""clear and convincing evidence,"" they would be granted asylum without a second interview.  A supervisor would also review that decision. People not interviewed within the first 90 days would remain in the asylum queue, but become eligible for work permits. (Democratic state and city leaders have asked the Biden administration to issue work permits faster so fewer migrants rely on government services.) Rubio gave the impression that asylum officers would be more lenient and approve asylum more often than judges. Immigrant advocacy groups say the opposite. The ""rapid and truncated procedures will undermine the fairness and thoroughness of asylum screenings"" the American Immigration Lawyers Association said in a Feb. 5 statement. The bill made it harder for people to get asylum because immigration judges would not have the power to reverse asylum officers’ decisions, said the National Immigrant Justice Center. Currently, when asylum officers deny a case, it is sent to immigration courts. In this venue, people may apply for asylum again to prevent their deportation. Oftentimes, people who are denied asylum by asylum officers are granted asylum by immigration judges, said Bush-Joseph. She said this might be because by then people have had more time to find attorneys who ""may be able to find more evidence or experts who can support their case."""
Have there been more US mass shootings than days in 2024? Common statistic needs context,"February 16, 2024",Amy Sherman,"National, Crime, Guns","After a mass shooting in Kansas City, Missouri, left one woman dead and more than 20 people injured, President Joe Biden said ""gun violence ""is ripping apart"" families and American communities daily. On Valentine’s Day, the sixth anniversary of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, Biden reeled off a list of other shootings in the headlines, including three police officers wounded in Washington, D.C., and four students wounded at a high school in Atlanta. ""We’ve now had more mass shootings in 2024 than there have been days in the year,"" he said. Feb. 14 was 2024’s 45th day. The Gun Violence Archive, a frequently cited source, showed 49 mass shootings as of Feb. 15. We fact-checked similar comparisons in 2022 after the Uvalde, Texas, elementary school massacre and in 2023 after a mass shooting at Michigan State University. This common talking point is rooted in an American reality. But it isn’t as precise as it sounds. One issue, from a fact-checker’s perspective, is the lack of a universal definition for a ""mass shooting."" Politicians often cite reliable sources for this claim, but the organizations that track mass shootings use different criteria. Mass shootings are a small slice of gun deaths overall, which includes homicides and suicides. ""The public should view these incidents as one piece of the gun violence puzzle, not the only piece,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, executive director of the Regional Gun Violence Research Consortium at the Rockefeller Institute of Government. Different groups measure mass shootings based on the number of people shot, injured or killed. Some groups exclude gang violence or domestic violence, keeping the focus on events when a shooter fired a gun at random in public. The Gun Violence Archive, a data collection and research group, defines mass shootings as incidents in which at least four people are injured or killed, excluding the shooter. The archive counts 49 mass shootings in 2024, backing up Biden’s math. USA Today, The Associated Press and Northeastern University’s mass killings database tracks incidents in which four or more people, excluding the offender, were killed within a 24-hour time frame. (This database tracks incidents where the offender used a firearm or other weapons.) There have been seven mass killings so far in 2024. Mother Jones’ open-source database tracks shootings with at least three victims killed, while excluding shootings from some ""conventionally motivated crimes,"" such as armed robbery or gang violence. This database was last updated Dec. 6, 2023. There have been no mass shootings in 2024 that meet the Mother Jones database’s definition. The federal government uses different thresholds, too. After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, an act of Congress defined ""mass killings"" as three or more killings in one incident. But the FBI since 2013 has defined a mass shooting as four or more deaths, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service mirrored the FBI’s metric in 2015. This means the Feb. 14 Kansas City shooting, which killed one person and injured 22 people, is counted in the Gun Violence Archive, but not in all datasets. Whatever the definition, the number of mass shootings has generally been increasing. The Gun Violence Archive found 656 mass shootings in 2023, fewer than 2021, but up from 272 in 2014. The USA Today, AP and Northeastern University database found 2023 had the most mass shootings (39) and the most public mass shootings (10) since it began tracking in 2006. Gun violence experts generally agree that citing any database requires context about the definitions. James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist, said the Gun Violence Archive data has value, but it’s hard to compare the shooting in Kansas City, when one person was killed while many others were injured, to Uvalde, where 20 people, mostly children, were killed. When people hear 49 mass shootings, Fox said, ""they think these things like Uvalde and school shootings (are) happening every day. They are not."" Two well-known advocacy groups — the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and Everytown for Gun Safety — cite the Gun Violence Archive. ""We choose to use this definition because we believe it more fully captures the broader burden of mass shootings in the U.S., including the burden of nonfatal injuries,"" said Kelly Drane, the law center’s research director. (The law center is led by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who was injured in a mass shooting in a supermarket parking lot in 2018 that left six people dead.) Drane said that a mass shooting definition of four or more people killed would exclude the Michigan State University shooting that killed three people and wounded five more. ""The impact of this shooting on the victims and the broader MSU and Michigan community was and is significant,"" Drane said. Schildkraut said the archive’s broad count does not account for context, putting mass public shootings in the same category as shootings among gangs or family members. ""In reality, however, these contextual differences have important implications for how we prevent and respond to these incidents,"" Schildkraut said. Mass public shootings are often premeditated, which creates a longer window for prevention than a spontaneous fight. Policies such as ""red flag"" laws, which allow courts to remove guns from people who could pose a threat to themselves or others, are helpful prevention tools for premeditated shootings but not for spontaneous ones, Schildkraut said. Gun violence researchers point out that mass shootings generate significant public attention even though they comprise a fraction of gun-related deaths. In 2021, about 3% of gun homicides were from mass shootings with at least four people shot. Using the more narrow definition of mass killings involving four or more people killed, that drops to slightly less than 1%, Fox said. Preliminary data shows that gun deaths, excluding suicides, declined for a second straight year in 2023. The Trace, a news website that covers gun violence, wrote that nearly 3  in 4 U.S. cities experienced a year-to-date drop in homicides, citing data from 175 cities. Schildkraut is waiting on final data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and additional research about what contributed to the change. Suicide has long accounted for the majority of U.S. gun deaths, according to April 2023 research by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan source of analysis. Polls show a significant percentage of people say they avoid attending certain events due to fears of gun violence or have considered avoiding such events. ""They are a particularly visible manifestation of a very large problem,"" said Garen Wintemute, director of the University of California, Davis’ Violence Prevention Research Program. ""They are uniquely capable of mobilizing public opinion in support of evidence-based measures that would have broad beneficial effects."" Mass shootings in Uvalde and Buffalo, New York, led Congress, under Democratic control, to pass the first gun control action in decades, Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. ""If that hadn’t happened, would the bill have passed or been as much of a priority?"" Schildkraut said. ""Hard to say, but the occurrence of Uvalde certainly did facilitate the interest in getting it across the finish line.""

"What's going on at the US-Mexico border, and what are asylum and parole?","February 16, 2024",Sophie Carson,"Immigration, National, Border Security, Wisconsin","With immigration a top issue heading into the 2024 election, politicians have been speaking often about the challenges at the southern U.S. border. The collapse of a bipartisan border security bill after months of negotiations between Republicans and Democrats was the latest chapter in the national political saga. The heated conversation over immigration often includes inaccuracies. For instance, a PolitiFact analysis in 2022 of a claim from U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., found his representation of a border apprehensions statistic to be misleading. To clear up common areas of confusion, we dived into the influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, and how the country found itself in this position. Plus: what do policies such as asylum and Title 42 look like in practice? Here's a guide to help you understand the debate. Agents encountered migrants at the southern border about 2,476,000 times in the 2023 fiscal year, which ran from October 2022 through September 2023, according to CBP data. That number includes people who tried to cross the border more than once. It also includes people who sought out border agents to claim asylum, and those who scheduled appointments to claim asylum at official ports of entry. Encounters include both the cases in which someone is apprehended or detained temporarily, then released into the U.S. with a future court date, and people who are turned away. The peak month was September, when agents encountered migrants nearly 270,000 times. But the 2024 fiscal year has topped that number. In December, the most recent month with available data, agents encountered migrants more than 302,000 times. Poor economic conditions, violence and instability in migrants’ home countries often push them to leave, and the appeal of a better life in the U.S. prompt people to embark on dangerous journeys to cross the border. Another reason for higher encounters is improved detection efforts by border agencies, according to a report from the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy group. ""As border security improves and becomes more effective, the total number of encounters are likely to rise as well,"" the report said. Customs and Border Protection data shows agents have encountered people more times in the 2023 fiscal year than in previous years. In 2022, CBP recorded 2,379,000 encounters. In 2021, there were 1,735,000 encounters. Now that Title 42 has ended, what happens to asylum seekers? Under the COVID-19-pandemic-era Title 42, most migrants were sent back over the border and denied the right to seek asylum. U.S. officials turned away migrants more than 2.8 million times. But there were no real consequences when someone illegally crossed the border. So, migrants were able to try again and again to cross, on the off chance they would get into the U.S. That's one of the common errors, equating encounters with actual people. The more people turned away consistently, the more this measuring stick can balloon as they try a second, third or fourth time. President Joe Biden ended Title 42 in May 2023. Now in place is Title 8, a set of long-standing immigration laws in the U.S. Code. U.S. law states that people have a right to claim asylum if they arrive at a border and express a ""well-grounded fear of persecution."" Border agents briefly screen people who say they fear returning to their home country. ""If you say, ‘I have a fear of return,’ it triggers a protection under our laws that ensures that a government official will review your case to see if you are likely to be successful with qualifying for asylum in the U.S.,"" said Erin Barbato, director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic at the University of Wisconsin. If migrants pass the initial screening, their cases go to the immigration court system, which will determine whether the migrants can stay in the U.S. But that process can take years. Usually, the migrants are released into the U.S. to wait out their cases because Border Patrol stations don't have the capacity to detain everyone. These are generally ""defensive asylum"" cases, in which people are placed in removal proceedings and must prove they should stay in the U.S. If asylum seekers lose the case, they face deportation. Asylum seekers with a court date have an incentive to go to their hearings because if they don't show up, they will be ordered deported, Barbato said. The asylum system is massively backlogged, with more than 1.1 million pending cases. Petitioners are waiting an average of nearly four years, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, at Syracuse University. But going through process is not a sure way to stay in the U.S. About 50% of asylum claims in the last fiscal year were denied, according to TRAC data. As they wait for their court dates, asylum seekers can apply for work permits. One point of debate during border bill negotiations in the Senate was humanitarian parole. That is the president's authority to allow migrants into the U.S. for special cases during emergencies or global unrest. It does not provide a path toward U.S. citizenship. Biden's administration has relied heavily on humanitarian parole. The U.S. airlifted nearly 80,000 Afghans and brought them to the U.S. after the Taliban takeover. The U.S. has admitted tens of thousands of Ukrainians who fled after the Russian invasion. Last year, the administration announced a plan to admit 30,000 people a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela via parole, provided those migrants had a financial sponsor and flew to the U.S. instead of going to the U.S.-Mexico border for entry. Also being admitted into the U.S. through the parole authority: migrants who make appointments through the CBP One phone app and are processed at official ports of entry. The Biden administration wants more people to be processed at these official border crossings instead of crossing unlawfully between ports. So, the administration has tried to encourage migrants in Mexico to schedule appointments through the CBP One app. There is an incentive for those who use the app and cross lawfully: a fast-track to legal work authorization. Glitches and challenges with the app are well documented. Many people try every morning to get an appointment in the lottery system. About 1,450 appointment slots are available each day. CBS News reported that in the app's first year, 450,000 migrants were allowed into the U.S. with the process. Migrants made more than 64.3 million requests to enter the country using the app, the outlet reported. Migrants who do book an appointment have a brief meeting with a border agent. If the migrants pass certain safety checks, they are released into the U.S. with a notice to appear in court at a certain date. They could go through the asylum process later. ""Most people, after that interview, are allowed to live in the United States, but they are in deportation proceedings. So they receive that Notice to Appear, and they also have to have a sponsor in the U.S.,"" Barbato said. Several Republican politicians have expressed concern about ""got-aways,"" people who crossed the border into the U.S. without being stopped by border agents. It is difficult to know exactly how many people entered without being inspected, but the Department of Homeland Security creates an estimate based on models and observations. For example, an agent may see people in the distance but can't reach them, or a sensor or surveillance tool detects that people are crossing. The Congressional Budget Office used DHS officials' public statements about got-aways to make its own estimate of 860,000 people in the 2023 fiscal year. Republicans have argued that people who cross undetected pose a security threat. Laurence Benenson, vice president of policy and advocacy at the National Immigration Forum, agrees that the government can do better at controlling the border, and that it's important to know who is crossing into the country. But Benenson also believes that most of the people who cross undetected are coming to the U.S. for the same reasons as those who encounter border agents. ""They come here for a better life, they come here to escape persecution, they come here to work and be with their families,"" he said. The Associated Press contributed to this report. "
Why Donald Trump’s boast that he got ‘delinquent’ NATO allies to ‘pay up’ is misleading,"February 14, 2024",Amy Sherman,"National, Foreign Policy, Ukraine, Russia","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spurred international alarm when he said he would ""encourage"" Russia to ""do whatever the hell they want"" to a NATO member country that didn’t ""pay"" for collective defense. Trump made the comment Feb. 10 at a Conway, South Carolina, rally as he described a conversation with an unnamed NATO country leader during his presidency. Trump used the story to claim that he was tough on NATO and got results, misrepresenting several facts about the alliance and his record in the process. ""I got them to pay up,"" Trump said. ""NATO was busted until I came along. I said, ’Everybody’s gonna pay.’ They said, ‘Well, if we don’t pay, are you still going to protect us?’ I said, ‘Absolutely not.’ They couldn't believe the answer, and you never saw more money pour in."" NATO’s chief, European leaders and President Joe Biden criticized Trump’s remarks, with Biden saying Trump was too friendly to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some Republicans downplayed what Trump said; others criticized him. We can’t fact-check whether that conversation happened, but we can examine how and why European defense spending changed under Trump (and other leaders). First, an important clarification: No countries are ""delinquent"" on NATO payments. For years, Trump has misrepresented a spending target for each country’s defense as payments owed to the alliance. ""Countries falling short will have weaker defenses than we would like, but they are not delinquent,"" said Stephen Saideman, a professor at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs. Many member countries have increased national defense spending since 2014. But European leaders were probably thinking of a leader other than Trump. ""If any one person is responsible for getting Europeans to spend more on defense, it’s Vladimir Putin,"" wrote Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Foreign Affairs, and a U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO during part of the Obama administration. ""Not Donald Trump."" We contacted Trump spokespeople and got no response. John Bolton, who was Trump’s national security adviser in 2018 and is now a Trump critic, told The Washington Post that Trump pressed NATO partners aggressively to increase military spending, ""but he didn’t say anything about not defending anybody against Russia."" NATO, formally the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was created in 1949 to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. The alliance has 31 members, including the United States. The alliance agreed that an armed attack against one or more of them would constitute an attack against them all, and each member would take action, including armed force. NATO countries do not pay money into a broad NATO defense budget; each country determines its own level of military spending. In 2014, after Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, NATO’s heads of state and government agreed to spend 2% of their GDP on defense by 2024, a target that had been discussed for many years. The agreement was aspirational, not binding. Countries are not ""delinquent"" if they’ve missed that target. ""They're welching on a commitment, but there is no enforcement mechanism,"" said Justin Logan, Cato Institute director of defense and foreign policy studies. The 2% target is ""about each country investing in their own defense so that the alliance as a whole could be stronger, better able to deter or defeat various threats (mostly Russia),"" Saideman said. NATO wasn’t ""busted"" when Trump became president in 2017. NATO defense spending has been increasing since the 2014 Crimea annexation, and spending accelerated after Russia further invaded Ukraine in 2022, Jeremy Shapiro, the European Council on Foreign Relations’ research director, told PolitiFact. Justin Logan, the Cato Institute’s defense and foreign policy studies director, said Russia’s attacks and Trump’s statements affected the allies’ spending decisions. ""Poland’s skyrocketing spending, for instance, has everything to do with fear of Russia,"" Logan said. Poland increased its defense spending as a share of GDP from about 2.4% in 2022 to 3.9% in 2023. As of July 2023, NATO reported that 11 countries met the 2% GDP goal: Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, the United Kingdom and the United States. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Feb. 14 that he expects 18 allies to spend 2% of GDP on defense in 2024 — a sixfold increase since 2014, when only three allies met the target. ""Politically, meeting the 2% level keeps your country out of the spotlight and in a general state of political grace,"" Logan said, ""which is why so many tiny and vulnerable East European countries do so."" Logan offered caveats about focusing on the 2%-of-GDP target. Two percent ""of the German economy is more than double the entire Estonian economy,"" pointing to GDP. Many of the members meeting the target — Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia — offer almost no usable military power. ""France and Turkey, which don’t meet the 2% standard, have far more firepower than most of those who meet the standard,"" Logan said. Trump is wrong to say that his threats alone prompted NATO allies to increase defense funding. The Barack Obama and Biden administrations also called for increased European defense spending. ""It is impossible to say whether Trump’s threats had more of an impact than Obama and Biden’s appeals to solidarity,"" Shapiro said. Biden and top officials have supported the 2% target. When Biden met with Stoltenberg in June 2023, Biden said, ""We’re going to be building on that momentum, from working to ensure that Allies spend enough on the defense, the 2 percent — not just as a hike, but that’s the bottom line."" Every American president since Harry S. Truman urged European allies to do more, Daalder wrote. ""Trump was hardly the first. Nor the last.""

Fact-checking Sunday show spin on the special counsel’s findings on Joe Biden’s classified documents,"February 13, 2024",Louis Jacobson,Legal Issues,"The special counsel report on President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents was a major discussion topic on the Sunday morning political talk shows. The president’s critics played up Special Counsel Robert Hur’s description of Biden’s allegedly poor memory; defenders countered that such details were inaccurate, out of bounds for such a report, or both. The discussion yielded several examples of incomplete or inaccurate descriptions of what Hur wrote in the report. Here’s a rundown. Sarah Isgur, a former Justice Department official under former President Donald Trump appearing on ABC’s ""This Week,"" overstepped on the report’s findings about reasonable doubt. ""They found evidence that (Biden) willfully retained national security information. And even probably beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Isgur said. ""But the justice manual says that that's not enough even if you can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. You have to believe, as the prosecutor, that you can get a conviction from a jury."" In the report’s executive summary, Hur wrote that ""we conclude that the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."" The report repeats the concern about not achieving proof beyond reasonable doubt roughly two dozen more times throughout the 388 pages of text. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., appearing on ""Fox News Sunday,"" exaggerated the similarities between the Biden documents case and the one being pursued by Jack Smith, a different special counsel, against Trump. Willfully disclosing classified material is ""exactly what Donald Trump’s been charged with,"" Cotton said. ""The special counsel had to explain why he wasn’t going to charge President Biden with a crime, since President Trump is facing the exact same crime and the explanation is, President Biden’s memory is failing."" There is overlap between the willful retention charge that Hur considered against Biden and the document case charges against Trump. However, Cotton ignored other charges that were made against Trump and not against Biden. When Trump was indicted in June 2023 on about three dozen counts, the charges included conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements. The indictment accused Trump of ""suggesting that his attorney falsely represent to the FBI and grand jury that Trump did not have the documents called for by the grand jury subpoena."" directing an employee ""to move boxes of documents to conceal them from Trump’s attorney, the FBI and the grand jury."" ""suggesting that his attorney hide or destroy documents."" causing the submission of a certification to the FBI and grand jury ""falsely representing"" that all documents had been produced. In his report, Hur stated that Biden had consistently cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation. Hur specifically noted that this was a major point of contrast with how Biden and Trump handled classified documents after they left office. Several hosts and guests on the shows omitted a key word — ""evidence"" — when summarizing what the report said. Although the report sometimes reads as if the special counsel mentally concluded that Biden was guilty of willful retention of classified documents, Hur’s phrasing is more circumspect. Here’s how several Sunday show guests went beyond what the report said: The report ""codified the fact that … Biden committed a felony and willful retention of documents."" — ""This Week"" guest Reince Priebus, President Donald Trump’s first chief of staff. The special counsel wrote that Biden ""‘willfully and knowingly retained classified documents.’"" — Chris Christie, former New Jersey governor and former Republican presidential candidate, on NBC’s ""Meet the Press."" ""The report makes it clear President Biden intentionally took classified material and he willfully disclosed it to his own ghostwriter. That’s clear."" — Cotton on ""Fox News Sunday."" (Cotton’s reference to Biden’s ghostwriter concerns his 2017 memoir, ""Promise Me, Dad."" The special counsel found evidence that Biden shared classified information with his ghostwriter as the book was being written, though no classified material appeared in the book.) Also, hosts Jonathan Karl on ABC’s ""This Week"" and Kristen Welker on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" didn’t use the word ""evidence"" when referring to the report on their shows, and a graphic behind Welker’s shoulder also omitted the word. In each case, this framing goes beyond what the report said. To be fair, our initial article on the special counsel’s report also did not appreciate the distinction between including or omitting the word ""evidence."" We decided to update our earlier story given feedback from experts for this one. At the beginning of the report, the special counsel said the investigation ""uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials."" The phrase ""uncovered evidence that"" offers a limit on what the special counsel concluded. The special counsel said Biden would likely be able to muster counterevidence against a charge of ""willful retention"" if the case were to go to trial. Several legal experts told PolitiFact that omitting the ""uncovered evidence that"" phrasing is not trivial. ""Saying that there is evidence of a crime is not the same as saying Biden is guilty of a crime,"" said Joan Meyer, who has worked as a prosecutor at the federal and local level. Ric Simmons, an Ohio State University law professor, said the special counsel was consistent. The report ""always says that there is evidence that Biden committed these crimes, not that he is guilty of these crimes, and this is consistent with the best practices of prosecutors,"" he said. In essence, Simmons said, ""Hur says that he does not believe he can prove Biden's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, so it would be even worse for him to claim that Biden is guilty."" Biden’s legal team referred to a handwritten memo Biden wrote to then-President Barack Obama about Afghanistan around Thanksgiving 2009. It was among the materials FBI agents recovered from Biden's Delaware garage and home office in December 2022 and January 2023. ""Even the special counsel acknowledges (that this) was one that he would not have thought would include classified information,"" Bob Bauer, Biden’s personal attorney, said on CBS ""Face the Nation."" The report said: ""The memo concerned deliberations from more than seven years earlier about the Afghanistan troop surge, and in the intervening years those deliberations had been widely discussed in public, so Mr. Biden could have reasonably expected that the memo's contents became less sensitive over time."" ""Less sensitive"" is not the same as having zero classified information. However, the report acknowledged that if the charges came to trial, ""We expect the defense would strongly challenge whether the documents still contain sensitive national defense information."""
Ask PolitiFact: Were the pictures in the Jesus ‘washed feet’ Super Bowl ad AI-generated?,"February 13, 2024",Madison Czopek,"Sports, Technology","Trusting what you see is harder than ever these days. During Super Bowl LVIII, artificial intelligence appeared in multiple ads, as a product, a highlighted feature of a product or as the butt of a joke. For some viewers, AI was so top of mind that they started seeing it even where it wasn’t. In one case, a 60-second commercial for the campaign ""He Gets Us"" prompted some social media users to ask: ""Was that Jesus commercial composed entirely of AI images?"" The minute-long ad, which aired during the game’s first quarter, featured more than 10 images that seemed surreal at first glance. It showed people of different ages, genders and races washing someone else’s foot in a variety of settings — a school hallway, a front yard, a desert landscape, a protest. Jesus washed the feet of friends and enemies. No ego or hate. He humbly loved his neighbors. How can we do the same? pic.twitter.com/kXift42ZG9— HeGetsUs (@HeGetsUs) February 11, 2024 Jesus washed the feet of friends and enemies. No ego or hate. He humbly loved his neighbors. How can we do the same? pic.twitter.com/kXift42ZG9 The ad opened with a still image of a dining room: In the foreground, a young man with short blond hair washed the feet of an older man with graying hair and glasses. The next image featured a young man in a dark alley with one foot on an overturned milk crate. A police officer used a 2-liter soda bottle and rag to wash the young man’s foot. The third image shows what looks like a high school hallway, with two students in the foreground, one pouring water on the foot of the other. A slowed-down cover of the INXS song ""Never Tear Us Apart"" played as the ad transitioned from image to image. Text at the very end said: ""Jesus didn’t teach hate,"" in all-capital letters. ""He washed feet."" The commercial referred viewers to the website HeGetsUs.com/LoveYourNeighbor. Many viewers on Reddit and on social media questioned whether the visuals depicted real people or were created using artificial intelligence. PolitiFact’s verdict: No, the images from the He Gets Us Super Bowl commercial were not AI-generated. They were photographs taken by fine-art photographer Julia Fullerton-Batten. She confirmed she took the photos in an email to PolitiFact, and He Gets Us credited them to her. Fullerton-Batten’s website describes her photography style as ""highly cinematic visual storytelling,"" and says that in her larger projects, each image ""embellishes her subject matter in a series of thought-provoking narrative ‘stories.’ The site says that by using ""unusual locations, highly creative settings, street-cast models, accented with cinematic lighting"" Fullerton-Batten’s ""insinuates visual tensions in her images and imbues them with a mystique that teases the viewer into continually re-examining the picture.""  (Screenshot from YouTube) On its website, He Gets Us says it is a campaign created by a ""diverse group of Jesus fans and followers with a variety of faith journeys"" that aims to ""move beyond the mess of our current cultural moment to a place where all of us are invited to rediscover the love story of Jesus – Christians, non-Christians, and everybody in between."" He Gets Us says it is managed by Come Near, a nonprofit organization. A He Gets Us spokesperson said the ad was created by Lerma, a Dallas-based advertising agency. Lerma spokesperson Jon Lee told Ad Age that Fullerton-Batten’s photography portrays ""an idealistic kind of world."" ""We took these different subjects that might be considered to be ideologically different than one another and we created this new style to imagine what the world might look like,"" he said. Lee said the ad’s intent was ""to share the authentic love that Jesus showed to all people."" The ad was based on a Bible story about Jesus washing the disciples’ feet, a lesson of humility  in service to others. Lerma did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. A He Gets Us blog post said the ""images of people washing each other’s feet look a little strange and disconcerting because it’s not part of our modern-day customs. But there’s also something beautiful and profound in each image."" PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report."
Fact-checking claims about what special counsel report said about Biden,"February 12, 2024",Jeff Cercone,"National, Criminal Justice, Legal Issues","Special counsel Robert Hur on Feb. 8 released his long-awaited report into President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents. Social media users then parsed Hur’s words from the report to make unfounded claims about the report’s conclusions. Hur said in his report he declined to prosecute Biden, but noted there was evidence Biden willfully retained classified documents. The report’s contents also touched off a primetime news conference in which Biden defended himself from Hur’s many descriptions of Biden’s faulty memory. We fact-checked some of the claims. ""DOJ says Biden is unfit and (too) incompetent to stand trial."" — Feb. 9 Instagram post ""Federal government declares Biden mentally unfit for office, senile in damning report."" — Benny Johnson, Feb. 8 Facebook post These characterizations are inaccurate. Hur’s report made several references to Biden’s ""poor memory,"" writing that his memory ""was significantly limited"" during interviews with the special counsel. Hur cited that as one reason he declined to prosecute the president. Hur wrote about Biden’s ""diminished faculties and faulty memory"" and said Biden couldn’t remember when he was vice president or the year his son Beau died. The president denied these allegations. Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who is now president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, said the report did not declare Biden unfit or incompetent to stand trial. ""Incompetence is a legal term and means a criminal defendant does not understand the nature of the proceedings and is unable to assist in his or her defense. That is not what Hur said,"" Rahmani said. ""Nor did Hur address Biden's suitability to hold public office. It would have been inappropriate for him to do so."" Ric Simmons, an Ohio State University law professor, agreed the special counsel never said Biden was incompetent to stand trial or unfit for office. ""It said that a jury might be sympathetic to him because of his age and that his memory issues might make it harder to prove all the elements of the crime,"" Simmons said. The report also never said Biden was mentally unfit for office, Simmons said. ""The special counsel would have no way of ascertaining this,"" he said. Simmons said the report also did not use the word ""senile,"" despite its many references to Biden’s memory. ""This might fit in with some definitions of ‘senile,’ which is defined as a loss of mental functions due to old age, but it does not fit the usual connotation of senility, which is an inability to perform basic mental tasks,"" Simmons said. Special Counsel Robert Hur, seen here when he was a U.S. attorney in Baltimore in 2019, released a report Feb. 8, 2024, into President Joe Biden's handling of classified materials. (AP) ""Based on findings from his Justice Department, Joe Biden is identified as a criminal not suitable for trial."" —  Feb. 9 Instagram post The report neither identified Biden as a criminal, nor exonerated him. Hur suggested Biden might have committed a crime, writing, ""Our investigation uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen."" The report referred to documents related to Afghanistan and to handwritten notebooks from Biden’s time as vice president. But Hur declined to prosecute, saying ""we conclude that the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."" Simmons said although the report said there was sufficient evidence to charge Biden with a crime, Biden wasn’t identified in the report as a criminal. ""A prosecutor never ‘identifies’ someone as a criminal. They merely bring charges if they think there is sufficient evidence to convict,"" Simmons said. Hur wrote that getting a conviction would face several hurdles: Because the documents in question are almost 15 years old and about Afghanistan, a conflict that has ended, Biden’s defense would strongly question whether they still contained sensitive national security information. Biden was allowed to have the documents in his home while he was vice president through 2016 and again as president. ""It may be difficult to convince a jury they should care"" about his ""brief illicit possession of documents,"" Hur wrote. Biden would likely present himself to a jury as ""a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly mean with a poor memory."" It would not be easy persuading a jury to convict him of a serious felony ""that requires a mental state of willfulness,"" Hur wrote. Biden’s cooperation with the investigation would likely cause some jurors to think he kept the documents by mistake. Because the government was unlikely to get a conviction at trial, ""we decline prosecution,"" Hur wrote.

What Florida’s driver’s license policy change means for transgender people,"February 12, 2024",Grace Abels,"LGBTQ, Transportation, Florida","No one likes going to the DMV, but what drove LGBTQ+ activists in Florida to stage a ""die-in"" at the traditionally mundane administrative buildings on Feb. 9? Answer: a memo, shared online Jan. 29, from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles that transgender Floridians and their advocates say threatens to subject them to increased marginalization and harassment.

""Florida has taken unilateral administrative action and banned gender marker changes on drivers licenses,"" Alejandra Caraballo, a Harvard Law instructor and LGBTQ+ advocate, wrote on X. ""Any trans person who has had theirs changed is potentially subject to suspension. Anyone attempting to change it after could be criminally prosecuted for ‘fraud.’"" The memo from Robert Kynoch, the agency’s deputy executive director, detailed a policy change prohibiting Floridians from replacing their driver’s licenses to change what appears on the license next to the word ""sex."" The move comes ahead of two bills in the state Legislature that, if passed, would force a similar policy. (Source: Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles)

The agency’s action prevents transgender people from changing the ""M"" or ""F"" on an existing license. But it’s unclear how this change would affect new license applications or license-holders who have already changed their licenses to reflect their gender identities. The memo also said that when ""gender"" is used in the driver's license statute in Florida law, it refers to ""immutable biological and genetic characteristics."" It asserted that misrepresenting gender during the license application process could result in criminal or civil penalties. ""Gender"" is not defined in the chapter of the law that governs driver’s licenses and ID cards, and legal experts told PolitiFact they question whether the department is legally authorized to impose this statutory interpretation. Transgender legal advocates told PolitiFact they believe the policy change merits legal challenge but, with legislators seemingly poised to try to codify a similar rule, attorneys are watching and weighing their options. Here’s what we learned. Before the department’s policy change, people who provided a letter from a medical provider confirming they were undergoing gender transition treatment were allowed to change what appeared in the ""sex"" field of their license or ID — either ""M"" or ""F""—  to align with their gender identity, male or female. Although ""sex"" and ""gender"" are often used as synonyms, medical experts and most major medical organizations define these terms differently. Sex refers to a biological category determined by physical features such as genes, hormones and genitalia — male, female or intersex, which means they were born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t fit neatly into any category. Gender identity refers to someone’s internal sense of being a man, woman, something in-between or neither, experts say. For many people, their sex and gender are the same, but people who are transgender have a mismatch between the two.

Kynoch’s memo said the old policy that allowed people to get new licenses to reflect a gender change is ""not supported by statutory authority"" and cited Florida statute 322.17, which outlines conditions under which the department can issue a replacement license. That statute says a replacement can be issued if an ID is lost, stolen or if there is a change to someone’s name, address or driving restrictions. Replacing the license for a change in gender identity, therefore, is not supported by statute, the memo argued. Different sections of the law in Florida govern license ""renewals"" and ""replacement,"" so it is unclear whether people who had already changed their gender on their license could renew their existing licenses as is. The department did not answer PolitiFact’s questions about renewals. The memo’s final two paragraphs grabbed attention from LGBTQ+ advocates. It read:

""Furthermore, the term ‘gender’ in s. 322.08, F.S., does not refer to a person’s internal sense of his or her gender role or identification but has historically and commonly been understood as a synonym for ‘sex,’ which is determined by innate and immutable biological and genetic characteristics."" It is unclear what Kynoch based this definition of ""gender"" on. The portion of the law his memo cited says only that ""gender"" is one piece of information required to be collected on a license application, along with a person’s full name, proof of Social Security number, mailing address and more. The term itself is not defined. Molly Best, a department spokesperson, did not answer our questions about the source of the definition. Florida’s physical license labels the ""M""/""F"" field with the term ""sex."" But the law on licenses uses the term ""gender"" to describe what is required on a license application. University of Florida law professor Berta Esperanza Hernández-Truyol questioned the interpretation. ""While, to be sure, agencies issue regulations, it is very arguably beyond their purview to single-handedly reinterpret statutory law,"" she said. ""Especially with the attempted redefinition of ‘gender’ which, as a term of art, has a different meaning from ‘sex.’"" Simone Chriss, a lawyer and the director of the Transgender Rights Initiative at the Southern Legal Counsel, criticized the memo as ""creating a definition that doesn’t exist"" in the statute. Chriss’ firm is suing Florida over other anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, including the state’s restrictions on gender-affirming care and policies regarding the use of pronouns in school that don’t align with biological sex. The rule change comes as the state Legislature considers H.B. 1639 and H.B. 1233, bills that would codify that a person’s license reflects a person’s ""sex."" The bills define ""sex"" as ""the classification of a human person as either male or female based on the organization of the body of such person for a specific reproductive role."" The memo also said ""misrepresenting one’s gender, understood as sex, on a driver license constitutes fraud"" and ""subjects an offender to criminal and civil penalties, including cancellation, suspension, or revocation of his or her driver license."" It is uncertain under what circumstances such criminal charges could be applied or enforced. For example, how would it apply to transgender people who already have licenses that were changed to reflect their gender? Would there be consequences for people who apply for new licenses using primary documents that have already been legally changed to reflect their gender identity. The agency did not answer questions about this portion of the memo. Legal experts told PolitiFact they do not expect people who got their licenses changed before the memo to face fraud charges. Best said that the policy didn’t change the process for ""establishing gender"" on a new Florida license or ID. When applying for a new Florida license, residents must bring at least one primary identifying document — a passport, birth certificate, or certificate of citizenship, for example. Gender ""must be taken from a primary identification document,"" according to the technical advisory distributed alongside the memo. (Source: Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles) But people can change what appears as their gender on U.S. passports and, in many states, on their birth certificates, leaving open the question of how this fits in with the memo’s assertion that ""misrepresenting one’s gender … constitutes fraud."" In response to PolitiFact’s questions, Best said, ""In Florida, you do not get to play identity politics with your driver license,"" and that ""to obtain a license … requires satisfactory proof of identity, including your biological sex.""

Best directed us to a department website that explains what documents people need when applying for driver’s licenses. The law requires ""satisfactory"" proof of identity including name and ""gender."" We found no evidence, however, that Florida law requires proof of one’s biological sex in order to obtain a new ID or license. LGBTQ+ advocates say the Florida highway safety department’s change could risk trans people’s privacy and open them to discrimination or prejudice. ""If you can’t update the gender marker on your ID, you are essentially outed as transgender at every turn,"" said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. This can happen during interactions with potential landlords, employers, cashiers, bartenders, restaurant servers and more.

""You risk being subjected to discrimination by strangers on a regular basis,"" Heng-Lehtinen said. By having to present an ID that doesn’t match how someone appears or refers to themselves, they might face invasive personal questions in job interviews or be questioned by police at a traffic stop about whether their ID is fraudulent, advocates said.

According to the Movement Advancement Project, a non profit think tank that tracks LGBTQ+ policies, most states have some mechanism for changing the ""M"" or ""F"" on licenses, but states such as Iowa are considering laws to restrict that. Other states are considering laws that would formally define ""sex"" and ""gender"" or block people from amending their birth certificates to reflect their gender identity."
3 conspiracy theories Putin promoted in his Tucker Carlson interview that Carlson didn’t challenge,"February 9, 2024",Jeff Cercone,"PunditFact, Ukraine, Russia","Russian President Vladimir Putin voiced numerous unsubstantiated and conspiratorial views during his sprawling conversation with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Carlson, who promoted the interview as an antidote to what he described as ""corrupt"" media, offered little pushback. Over two hours and six minutes, Carlson provided Putin a platform to push baseless narratives — at times assisting with the effort. When Carlson asked Putin who was responsible for blowing up Nord Stream, the natural gas pipeline network that runs from Russia to Europe, Putin blamed the U.S. for the 2022 incident — and Carlson appeared to concur. Unmentioned: No state has taken responsibility for the blasts, which were ruled deliberate. At moments, it seemed Carlson was gearing up to challenge Putin, but he ended up conceding the point. Carlson asked Putin whether Russia would release Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, 32, who has been held for close to a year on espionage charges stemming from a reporting trip in Russia. ""The guy’s obviously not a spy,"" Carlson said before offering, ""Maybe he was breaking your law in some way, but he’s not a super spy, and everybody knows that."" Putin responded by insisting otherwise. ""He’s not just a journalist,"" Putin said before the line of questioning ended. Unmentioned: The U.S. State Department, The Wall Street Journal and the Committee to Protect Journalists insist Gershkovich is being wrongly held. The Wall Street Journal responded that the attempts to portray Gershkovich as anything but a journalist were ""total fiction."" With Putin signaling to Tucker Carlson that he is open to a prisoner exchange that would free Evan Gershkovich, the @WSJ has issued this new statement: pic.twitter.com/mwqBYFHIvN— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 9, 2024 With Putin signaling to Tucker Carlson that he is open to a prisoner exchange that would free Evan Gershkovich, the @WSJ has issued this new statement: pic.twitter.com/mwqBYFHIvN Carlson’s rhetoric has been increasingly Russia friendly in recent years, with Carlson questioning the United States’ support for Ukraine following Russia’s Feb. 24, 2022, invasion and pushing Kremlin propaganda about the war. Carlson’s remarks have been broadcast by Russian state media on multiple occasions. Carlson didn’t fact-check Putin, so we did. Here are three conspiracy theories Putin shared: Putin began the interview with a 30-minute near filibuster detailing the history of Russia and Ukraine by going back centuries. ""Ukraine is an artificial state that was shaped at Stalin’s will,"" Putin said, referring to former Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin. We’ve heard this from Putin before. What’s now Ukraine, he argued, was part of Russian territory as far back as the ninth century. In the interview, he said the Ukrainian state was established as part of the Soviet Union in 1922, and had never existed before then. After World War II, Ukraine was given land, including from Poland, Hungary and Romania, to which it had no historical claim, he said. Putin’s historical view is inaccurate and one-sided, historians told PolitiFact in 2022 after Putin launched the Ukraine war with a similar argument. Territory in Ukraine has been controlled by several countries or empires for hundreds of years before Russia gained hold. ""Putin’s aggression in Ukraine is justified through grievous historical distortions that conflate the Rus’ state, founded in the ninth century in Kyiv, with the Russian state, which only began to take shape in Moscow several hundreds of years later,"" said Faith Hillis, a University of Chicago history professor. Putin presents the Rus’ territory as Russia’s ""primordial heritage"" from more than 1,000 years ago, Hillis said. ""This distorted view of history is not Putin's invention,"" Hillis said. ""It is a rehashing of a narrative crafted by conservative defenders of the Russian empire in the nineteenth century."" Richard Arnold, a Muskingum University political science professor, said Putin’s reference to an ""artificial state"" may have something to do with the Soviet Theory of Ethnos, which holds that ethnic groups ""were objective and natural, created in part by solar rays determining the abundance of crops in certain areas of the globe, and that the groups had a consciousness."" ""Putin probably believes Ukraine is not a sufficiently ancient nation to be a ‘real’ ethnos, a ‘real’ nation,"" Arnold said. ""We can decide ourselves how scientifically rigorous such a concept is, which, if applied to the U.S., would suggest it is really a British nation."" Regardless of Putin’s theory, Arnold said, there were Ukrainian intellectuals in the 19th century who adopted nationalist language when discussing their country. Erik Herron, a West Virginia University political science professor, said the origins of Ukrainian statehood are complicated and have long been debated, but documented references to Ukraine are centuries old. ""Regardless of when a formal Ukrainian state emerged, it was not ‘shaped at Stalin’s will,’ and the foundations for it were built over centuries through the development of a unique national identity,"" Herron said.  In this photo the Sputnik news agency released Feb. 9, 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures while speaking during an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Feb. 6, 2024. (Sputnik, via AP) Putin has justified his invasion of Ukraine by claiming that Russia seeks to ""denazify"" Ukraine. During the interview, Carlson asked whether Putin had achieved the goals he had when he invaded Ukraine. ""No,"" Putin replied. ""We haven’t achieved our aims yet because one of them is denazification. This means the prohibition of all kinds of neo-Nazi movements."" There’s no evidence Ukraine is a Nazi state. This falsehood has been fact-checked by experts and news organizations, including PolitiFact. Historians who study genocides and the Holocaust decried Putin’s narrative as ""factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive."" Zelenskyy is Jewish and lost family in the Holocaust. Neo-Nazi groups exist in Ukraine — as they do in the U.S. and Russia — but Putin overstates their power. In 2014, the white-supremicist-led Azov battalion played a key role in fighting Russian separatists, and the battalion received appreciation from some within the Ukrainian government, but experts say it represents a small portion of Ukraine’s military, PolitiFact reported in 2022. The U.S. State Department has said Putin exploits a grain of truth to ""manipulate international public opinion by drawing false parallels between Moscow’s aggression against Ukraine and the Soviet fight against Nazi Germany."" John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, pointed to a 2019 Pew Research Center poll that found Ukraine was among the European countries with the highest percentage of people who expressed ""favorable views"" of Jews. ""If Ukraine was a hotbed of Nazis, then presumably antisemitism is going to be a disproportionately large problem,"" Herbst said, adding that before Zelenskyy, Ukraine had a Jewish prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman.  A woman cries in front of a house damaged during Russian shelling in the town of Vyshgorod near Kyiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 24, 2022. (AP) With Carlson’s prompting, Putin also argued that the U.S. isn’t being run by its elected officials. ""Twice you’ve described U.S. presidents making decisions and then being undercut by their agency heads,"" Carlson summarized. ""So it sounds like you're describing a system that’s not run by the people who are elected, in your telling."" ""That’s right, that’s right,"" Putin said. PolitiFact has repeatedly fact-checked the baseless conspiracy theory that ""the deep state,"" ""a secret cabal,"" or ""a shadow government"" plays an outsized role in American governance. Experts said Putin knew Carlson’s audience. ""Putin understands who listens to Tucker Carlson, and he knows that former President Trump and his allies have made references to the ‘deep state,’"" Herron said. ""This type of claim only fuels divisions in the U.S., and that is one of Putin’s goals."" Scott Radnitz, professor at the Jackson School of International Studies at the University of Washington, said that by ""signaling his agreement with Republican beliefs and repeating their talking points,"" Putin also hoped to ""build on their admiration for him."" Todd Helmus, a senior behavioral scientist at Rand Corp. who has studied Russia-led propaganda campaigns, said that Putin’s task for the interview was to speak to ""hardcore conservatives."" Pushing this narrative was Putin’s attempt to ""accentuate any divisions"" and advance lines that might ""harden opposition"" to the U.S. providing continued support for Ukraine. That Congress has not provided more aid for Ukraine helps disprove the idea of a shadow government working in Ukraine’s favor, Herron said. ""The president does not have deep state operatives or a shadow government funneling resources to Ukraine in defiance of Congress,"" Herron said. Elected leaders make budget decisions, ""and their preferences do not match the president’s preferences. Until this changes, aid for Ukraine’s war efforts is not coming from the U.S. budget precisely because of the decisions of elected leaders.""

"Fact-checking Joe Biden about sharing classified materials, keeping them in lockable cabinets","February 9, 2024",Grace Abels,"National, Legal Issues","In a Feb. 8 press conference responding to Special Counsel Robert Hur’s classified documents report, President Joe Biden made misleading and inaccurate statements about the documents — including how documents were stored in lockable cabinets in his home and who the material was shared with — points the report contradicts. Here are Biden’s statements and what the special counsel reported. 

""All the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked."" Although the report includes photos showing that some of the recovered classified materials were in filing cabinets, Biden’s claim that they ""all"" were is incorrect and does not match the details of the special counsel’s report.

The report said investigators found classified documents from 2009 stored in a ""badly damaged box surrounded by household detritus,"" such as a collapsed dog crate, a broken map and potting soil in the garage of Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware, home. The documents, which were related to U.S. foreign policy in Afghanistan, had classification markings ""up to the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information level,"" one of the highest levels of classification.

The report includes photos of the cardboard box that it said contained ""numerous hanging folders, file folders, and binders"" and was ""in a mangled state with ripped corners and two top flaps torn off."" Image of box containing classified documents in Biden’s Delaware garage, taken Dec. 21, 2022, from page 128 of Special Counsel report A Feb. 5 letter to Hur from the White House counsel that was appended to the released report acknowledged how the documents in the garage were stored: ""The evidence shows that this tattered box contained a random assortment of documents, including plainly unimportant ones."" The letter did not rebut the presence of the classified documents but pushed back on the report’s characterization that the box contained materials of ""great personal significance."" Classified materials from the 1970s, when Biden was a senator, also were found in boxes in a garage closet of his Delaware home.

The report said notebooks Biden kept while serving as vice president were found in other parts of the home, such as in ""unlocked drawers in the office and basement den.""

Some of the notebooks were in file cabinets, photographs show, but whether the cabinets were ""able to be locked,"" as Biden said, was not addressed. The report describes the place where the notebooks were found as ""unlocked drawers."" The notebooks contained classified information — sometimes on classified subjects, such as the President’s Daily Brief — and in other instances, the notes themselves were classified.

When questioned about Biden’s locked cabinets claim in a Feb. 9 press briefing, White House Counsel spokesperson Ian Sams said, ""I think the president was replying to a number of inaccurate allegations in this report."" ""I did not share classified information … with my ghostwriter, I did not. Guarantee you, did not."" Biden repeatedly told reporters this about his ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer, who worked on Biden’s 2017 memoir, ""Promise Me, Dad."" When a reporter countered that the special counsel said he had, Biden cut him off: ""Well, no, he did not say that. He did not say that."" Hur did say that. The report said Biden shared classified information with Zwontizer from notes he’d taken related to classified subjects such as the President's Daily Brief and National Security Council meetings. Hur said no classified material appeared in Biden’s book. The special counsel wrote that there’s evidence Biden knew the notebooks contained classified material, as he ""sometimes skipped over notebook passages to avoid reading classified information,"" when reading entries aloud during meetings with Zwontizer. Hur said Biden read to Zwontizer from classified entries ""nearly verbatim"" on at least three occasions, sometimes for an hour or more, but said evidence didn’t show that Biden knew the passages were classified or that he intended to share classified information. The report said after Zwonitzer learned of the investigation, he deleted audio recordings of his conversations with Biden. However, Zwonitzer turned over to the FBI his laptop computer and external hard drive and consented to a search. FBI technicians were able to recover deleted recordings. The report says Biden kept a handwritten memo he sent to former President Barack Obama over Thanksgiving in 2009 and mentioned it to Zwonitzer. ""In a recorded conversation with his ghostwriter in February 2017, about a month after he left office, Mr. Biden said, while referring to his 2009 Thanksgiving memo, that he had ‘just found all the classified stuff downstairs,’"" the report stated. The report doesn’t say that Biden gave Zwonitzer physical custody of the material. In his press conference, Biden didn’t address the classified material that he read to Zwontizer from his notebooks, but was adamant that the Obama memo didn’t include classified material. He said he should have instead used the word ""sensitive"" or ""private"" to describe it when talking to Zwonitzer. ""The fact of the matter is, what I didn't want repeated, I didn't want him to know and I didn't read it to him, was I had written a long memorandum to President Obama why we should not be in … in Afghanistan,"" Biden told reporters. ""And I was — it was multiple pages. And so, what I was referring to, I said classified, I should have said it was — should be private because it was a contact between a president and a vice president as to what was going on. That's what he’s referring to. It was not classified information in that document. That was not classified.""

During the press briefing, Sams, the White House counsel spokesperson, characterized the Obama memo as Biden’s ""own personal writings"" that Biden was sharing with Zwontizer for the memoir. ""I’ve seen headlines since the report was released about my willful retention of documents. This … assertion is not only misleading but just plain wrong."" This is more complicated than Biden described. Hur’s report says the investigation ""uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen."" It cites two categories of material: classified documents about Afghanistan, and handwritten notebooks that included references to sensitive intelligence sources and methods. Biden’s actions, the report said, ""risked serious damage to America's national security."" This portion of the report suggests that the special counsel team believed Biden had committed a crime. But the special counsel was tasked not only with finding facts, but also with deciding whether at least one charge should be prosecuted in court. In this case, the special counsel decided against prosecution, figuring that Biden could win over enough jurors to be found not guilty at trial, dooming the unanimous verdict required for a conviction. Read the whole story about willful retention of documents. ""None of it was high classified. It didn’t have any of that red stuff on it, you know what I mean, around the corners? None of that."" We rate Biden’s claim False. Intelligence experts told PolitiFact that there is no legal definition for information that is highly or ""high classified."" However, the special counsel report details that multiple Biden documents included classification markers for ""top secret,"" the highest of the three classification levels. An expert in national security cases said Biden’s claim about ""red stuff"" around the corners probably referred to cover pages often put on top of classified documents to signal that classified materials are inside. It’s unclear whether the special counsel found documents with these cover sheets. But experts clarified that not every document has a cover sheet. PolitiFact Senior Correspondent Louis Jacobson and Staff Writer Maria Ramirez Uribe contributed to this report. RELATED: Biden won’t be charged in classified documents case, but special counsel report questions his memory"
Biden classified documents: What special counsel report says about ‘willful retention’,"February 9, 2024",Louis Jacobson,Legal Issues,"Just hours after the release of a special counsel’s report on a document-retention case, President Joe Biden called a prime-time press conference to applaud the counsel’s decision not to prosecute him and to rebut the report’s suggestion that aging has left him with ""a poor memory."" Biden said media reports were misrepresenting the special counsel’s conclusion. ""I’ve seen headlines since the report was released about my willful retention of documents,"" he said Feb. 8. ""This … assertion is not only misleading but just plain wrong."" What the special counsel found is more complicated than Biden described. Yes, Special Counsel Robert Hur decided against pursuing criminal charges. However, the report states clearly that the special counsel found evidence that Biden did willfully retain classified documents. The decision not to prosecute was based on how likely it was that Biden could win over enough jurors to be found not guilty at trial. The special counsel’s report is worded carefully. Near the top of the executive summary, the report said the investigation ""uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen."" The executive summary specifies two categories of material at issue: classified documents about Afghanistan and handwritten notebooks that included references to sensitive intelligence sources and methods. The FBI found these materials in the garage, offices and basement den of Biden's Wilmington, Delaware, home. ""There is evidence that when Mr. Biden left office in 2017, he willfully retained his classified notebooks — that is, he knew he kept classified information in notebooks stored in his house and he knew he was not allowed to do so,"" the report said. ""There is also evidence that Mr. Biden willfully disclosed classified information in his notebooks to his ghostwriter by reading it aloud to him."" Biden’s actions, the report said, ""risked serious damage to America's national security."" This portion of the report suggests the special counsel team believed Biden had committed a crime. But the special counsel was tasked not just with finding facts, but with deciding whether at least one charge should be prosecuted in court. Ultimately, Hur decided that Biden’s defenses would likely be enough to convince one or more jurors that he didn’t commit a crime, dooming the required unanimous verdict for a conviction. This type of prosecutorial decision is akin to a risk-benefit analysis, based on prosecutors’ experience with how juries will respond at trial to certain types of evidence. ""If the quantum of evidence doesn’t meet that standard, you decline to prosecute,"" said Joan Meyer, a partner at the law firm Thompson Hine LLP. ""No one wants a high-profile loss in court."" The special counsel report noted several defenses that Biden could make that would make it hard to reach a unanimous guilty verdict. These included Biden’s consistent cooperation with the special counsel’s investigation, which a jury might interpret as an innocent man’s actions, to his forgetfulness, an issue on which Biden vigorously countered at his press conference. ""It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him — by then a former president well into his eighties — of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness,"" the report said. The special counsel also factored into its prosecution decision that at least one former president, Ronald Reagan, also took home diaries that likely included classified information and was not prosecuted for it. A potential Biden defense could also note that the special counsel cleared Biden of wrongdoing for other sets of documents at the University of Pennsylvania and other parts of Biden’s Delaware home. In addition, the special counsel on several occasions acknowledges a ""shortage of evidence"" even as he lays out details about the handling of the Afghanistan documents, which comprise the most serious legal threat to Biden in the report. If the case had gone to trial, the use of this language in the report could have helped Biden. Collectively, these potential defense arguments would make it hard for prosecutors to make a jury agree unanimously that Biden was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the standard for a criminal trial conviction. White House spokesperson Ian Sams, in a Feb. 9 press conference, seemed to acknowledge the fine distinctions by saying the special counsel concluded that ""there was no case."" This places the focus on the prosecutorial decision rather than a question of guilt or innocence. The special counsel ""reached the inevitable conclusion based on the facts and the evidence that there was no case here,"" Sams said. ""And this is important to think about in context of how this report is being viewed and by many of you being covered. This is the first special counsel investigation ever that hasn't indicted anyone. Every theory was explored. But the facts and the evidence disputed though the decision was that there was no case to be made."" In the legal system, it’s common for people to hover between innocence and guilt, said Ric Simmons, an Ohio State University law professor. Consider a defendant who is arrested while holding an illegal handgun. Say a court eventually ruled that the police search violated the Fourth Amendment, which guards against unreasonable government searches and seizures. If that happened, there would be a good chance the prosecution would forgo a trial for lack of evidence. Or consider an impoverished mother who steals baby food to feed her child. Given the defendant’s backstory, ""no jury would convict,"" Simmons said. ""The best way to think about these cases is that the individual is factually guilty — there is sufficient evidence to prove to an objective evaluator that the defendant committed all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt — but that they are not and never will be legally guilty,"" Simmons said. In Biden’s case, the special counsel appears to believe Biden is factually guilty even if he isn’t confident it could prove at trial that Biden is legally guilty. ""Whether Biden did or did not willfully retain and disclose classified documents is at this point a disputed issue of fact,"" Simmons said. ""The special counsel says he did. Biden says he did not. One of them is wrong, and unless this is proven in court one way or the other, or Biden ultimately admits to the willfulness, we will never know for sure which of them is wrong."" Biden stopped short of using the word ""exonerate,"" a word his predecessor and likely 2024 presidential race rival, Donald Trump, used to describe the report of a different special counsel, Robert Mueller, in an investigation of connections between Trump and Russia. If Biden meant to imply that he’s been exonerated, that would go too far, Meyer said. ""The report did not exonerate Biden,"" she said. ""It found that he used sloppy procedures to handle classified materials and that he retained them, most importantly the handwritten notebooks of his vice presidency, to write a book."""
"Biden won’t be charged in classified documents case, but special counsel report questions his memory","February 9, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"National, Corrections and Updates, Legal Issues","A special counsel investigating President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents concluded that no criminal charges were warranted. However, Robert Hur in his final report criticized Biden’s practices in handling sensitive documents, saying he had found evidence that Biden had ""willfully retained and disclosed classified materials"" as a private citizen after he served as vice president. In a 388-page report, the special counsel also dwelled on Biden’s lapses in memory, writing that ""Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" The portrayal of Biden, who is 81 as he seeks another term, offers useful campaign material for Biden’s likely opponent, former President Donald Trump, 77, and the characterization drew strong White House criticism in a letter appended to the special counsel’s report. But the report also preempted comparisons with Trump, stating that Trump’s own classified documents prosecution — which a separate special counsel, Jack Smith, is handling — has ""several material distinctions"" from Biden’s. A big one is that Biden cooperated with the investigation while Trump thwarted federal efforts to retrieve documents. ""According to the indictment, (Trump) not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it,"" Hur wrote in the report. Hur found evidence that Biden willfully retained classified documents about Afghanistan and notebooks containing Biden’s handwritten notes about security and foreign policy. The report detailed some of Biden’s haphazard storage practices, saying some of the Afghanistan documents were ""found in Mr. Biden's Delaware home: in a badly damaged box in the garage, near a collapsed dog crate, a dog bed, a Zappos box, an empty bucket, a broken lamp wrapped with duct tape, potting soil, and synthetic firewood."" After an investigation that included more than 100 witnesses, Hur’s team wrote that, despite the investigators’ concerns about how Biden had handled certain materials, a jury would be unlikely to find Biden guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In a statement after the report’s release, Biden said he was pleased that the investigation, which he described as ""exhaustive,"" yielded no charges. ""I cooperated completely, threw up no roadblocks, and sought no delays,"" Biden said, adding that he agreed to five hours of interviews on Oct. 8 and 9 despite dealing with an international crisis after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. Although the lack of prosecution is a victory for Biden, the picture Hur paints ""is not a pretty one,"" said Joan Meyer, a partner at law firm Thompson Hine LLP. ""It is clear that Biden, as vice president and as a senator, employed sloppy procedures to handle classified materials, including leaving them on tables and in unlocked drawers. His staff was similarly negligent."" According to the report, Biden retained materials that included marked classified documents about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan and notebooks containing Biden's handwritten entries about national security and foreign policy issues that included sensitive intelligence sources and methods.

These included a classified, handwritten memo he sent President Barack Obama over Thanksgiving in 2009. FBI agents recovered the materials from Biden's garage and home office in Wilmington, Delaware. The documents have classification markings up to the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information level, the report said. The report also offered evidence that Biden knew he possessed classified documents. ""In a recorded conversation with his ghostwriter in February 2017, about a month after he left office, Mr. Biden said, while referring to his 2009 Thanksgiving memo, that he had ‘just found all the classified stuff downstairs,’"" the report stated. Biden also handwrote notes related to classified subjects, including the President's Daily Brief and National Security Council meetings, and kept them in unsecured and unauthorized places at his Virginia and Delaware homes, the report said. Biden used some of the notebooks for materials for a 2017 memoir, ""Promise Me, Dad."" Investigators found that Biden shared some classified information with his ghostwriter as the book was written, though no classified material appeared in the book. FBI agents recovered the notebooks from the office and basement den. After learning of the investigation, the ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer, deleted audio recordings of his conversations with Biden. However, Zwonitzer turned over his laptop computer and external hard drive and consented to a search. FBI technicians were able to recover deleted recordings. Zwonitzer also kept some near verbatim transcripts. Biden ""sometimes skipped over notebook passages to avoid reading classified information,"" Hur wrote, and if Zwonitzer was called to testify, Zwonitzer would state that Biden said he needed to be careful ""because he was worried that there was a possibility that ... some of this stuff (handwritten entries in the notebooks) could be classified."" The report described Biden as ""emphatic"" about his right to his notebooks, declaring that the materials were his ""property"" and that he told them ""every president before me has done the exact same thing,"" referring to keeping handwritten classified materials after leaving office. Biden cited the example of Ronald Reagan, who kept diaries of his presidency containing classified information, and he was not charged. Hur considered that precedent in deciding not to charge Biden. Changing the standard ""would be seen by many to violate basic principles of notice and fairness,"" the report said. This image, contained in the report from special counsel Robert Hur, shows boxes in a storage closet at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, in March 2021. (Justice Department via AP) Hur considered several factors when weighing whether to charge Biden, including the volume of classified information, the sensitivity of the information, Biden’s motivations and his actions surrounding the documents. Although the volume of classified information ""is not small"" and ""could support a decision to bring criminal charges, it does not require such charges,"" Hur wrote. The Afghanistan documents concerned ""a conflict that is now over,"" he wrote, and although the notebook entries contained ""some highly sensitive information"" dating as late as 2017, the Reagan precedent moved him away from prosecution. However, Hur noted that some of the findings didn’t favor Biden. If Biden retained documents intentionally, Hur wrote, ""he appears to have done so to defend his record and burnish his credentials to run for president. This factor counts against him. It is difficult to conceive of good reasons to risk the nation's security by mishandling classified information, and bolstering one's reputation is not one."" The special counsel repeatedly highlighted what the team considered Biden’s ""limited"" and ""poor"" memory, saying that at various points in his interview sessions, Biden didn’t remember when he was vice president and forgot when his term ended and when his term began. ""He did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died,"" the report added. It also said Biden’s memory appeared hazy when describing the debate to send troops to Afghanistan, mistakenly saying he ""had a real difference"" of opinion with Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, although Eikenberry was an ally whom Biden had cited approvingly. The White House aggressively rebutted the portrayal of Biden as someone with failing faculties. On Feb. 5, after the report was sent to the White House for review, the White House wrote a letter saying the report’s discussion of Biden’s memory was neither ""accurate or appropriate."" ""The report uses highly prejudicial language to describe a commonplace occurrence among witnesses: a lack of recall of years-old events,"" said the letter, which was appended to the special counsel’s report. ""Such comments have no place in a Department of Justice report, particularly one that in the first paragraph announces that no criminal charges are ‘warranted'’ and that ‘the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden's guilt.’"" Trump and Biden both had documents with classification markings stored in unauthorized locations while they were private citizens. However, legal experts see important differences, too, based on how the two presidents interacted with federal officials who were investigating classified document handling. Hur’s report makes a point of contrasting the significant differences between the two cases. ""After being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite,"" the report said. ""According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it."" Biden, by contrast, ""turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations including his homes, sat for a voluntary interview, and in other ways cooperated with the investigation."" Meyer of Thompson Hine said ""Biden’s mishandling of classified materials is not comparable to Trump. ""Trump’s case is replete with deliberate, willful behavior."" Meyer added that ""Trump had very recent classified information, kept in the open, that could have been stolen or given to any number of hostile countries to the detriment of the United States."" After the report was released, Trump seized on the report’s criticism of Biden, saying in an emailed statement that Biden’s case was ""100 times"" severer than his and that what Biden did was ""outrageously criminal."" Trump also repeated, inaccurately, that Trump was covered by the Presidential Records Act. In a statement on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""I was cooperative with the investigators. He wrote that Biden didn’t cooperate and ""willfully retained"" the documents. This retelling of the story clashes with what both special counsels have found. Trump was charged in 2023 with 31 counts of willful retention of national defense information. Someone who willfully retains a covered document and ""fails to deliver it to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it"" can be fined or imprisoned if found guilty. Beyond the charges of ""willful retention,"" Trump was charged with a conspiracy to obstruct justice by hiding and concealing documents, withholding a document from a grand jury, corruptly concealing a document or record from a grand jury; and concealing a document in a federal investigation.

U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on removing Donald Trump from ballot. Here’s what to know.,"February 8, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"National, Elections, Legal Issues, Supreme Court","In a case with implications for the 2024 presidential election, the U.S. Supreme Court heard historic oral arguments Feb. 8 that former President Donald Trump should be removed from Colorado’s presidential primary ballot. The Colorado Supreme Court in December ruled that Trump was ineligible to be on the ballot because of his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. The Colorado court cited an obscure provision in the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment that bars people from holding office if they ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion."" The high court’s ruling, which is likely to come before Colorado’s March 5 primary, will have ripple effects for other states facing similar legal challenges to Trump’s ballot access. The last time the Supreme Court played such a pivotal role in the presidential race was in 2000, when the justices ruled 5-4 to end a Florida recount, sealing the election for George W. Bush over Al Gore. Here, we explain the 14th Amendment, why the Supreme Court is hearing this case, and what the parties’ arguments are for and against removing Trump from the ballot. On the first day of arguments, justices from across the ideological spectrum sounded skeptical of one state removing Trump from the ballot. ""I think that the question that you have to confront is why a single state should decide who gets to be president of the United States,"" Justice Elena Kagan, one of the three liberal judges in the nine-seat court, asked Jason Murray, the lawyer arguing in favor of removing Trump. It ""seems quite extraordinary, doesn't it?"" Several constitutional law scholars told PolitiFact they sensed that the court would rule that  Trump could stay on the ballot, perhaps with two or fewer dissents. ""I think it’s almost certain that Trump wins this,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. He and others added, though, that we won’t know the majority’s precise legal reasoning until the court issues its ruling. The amendment is best known for giving Black people the right to become United States citizens. But Section 3 of the amendment also says that no person ""shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military"" who had previously taken an oath to support the Constitution and then ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof."" It also says Congress ""may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability."" When Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, it followed weeks of Trump’s statements seeking to overturn his election loss, including a speech he gave in Washington, D.C., shortly before the attack. Section 3 was intended to prevent people who served in the Confederacy from again serving in public office unless they were cleared by congressional vote. In 1872, Congress granted amnesty to most officials covered by Section 3, and in 1898, another statute lifted the remaining prohibitions. Section 3 was rarely invoked in the 20th century. The Colorado Supreme Court ruled 4-3 to disqualify Trump from the presidential primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. The court concluded that Trump had engaged in an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. The Colorado court stayed its ruling, allowing the secretary of state to include Trump’s name on the ballot. The case’s plaintiff is a Republican and former Colorado state legislator whom Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal-leaning group, recruited. Similar cases are pending in a half-dozen states, while many others have been dismissed. Trump’s lawyer, Jonathan Mitchell, argued that the former president is not an ""officer of the United States,"" which he said refers only to appointed officials and not elected officials. Section 3 refers to people who have taken an oath and are officers of the U.S. He also argued that for states to remove candidates from the ballot, Congress would have to pass legislation. Mitchell said Jan. 6, 2021, was not an insurrection, which he said requires ""an organized concerted effort to overthrow the government of the United States through violence."" That drew rebuttal from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who said, ""Your point is that a chaotic effort to overthrow the government is not an insurrection?"" Mitchell responded that Jan. 6, 2021, was a ""riot"" and not an insurrection. ""The events were shameful, criminal, violent, all of those things, but did not qualify as insurrection as that term is used in Section 3,"" he said. Murray, the lawyer arguing to remove Trump, said that Trump is an officer of the United States. ""There is no possible rationale for such an exemption,"" Murray said. ""Section 3 uses deliberately broad language to cover all positions of federal power requiring an oath to the Constitution."" Murray also said Trump’s arguments ignore the constitutional role of the states in running presidential elections. ""States are allowed to safeguard their ballots,"" by excluding those who are younger than 35, running for a third term or as in the case of Trump, ""those who have engaged in insurrection against the Constitution in violation of their oath."" Many justices appeared skeptical of removing Trump from the ballot, noting implications for democracy. If the Colorado ruling stands, Chief Justice John Roberts said, many states could remove the Democratic candidate and other states could remove the Republican candidate. ""It will come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential election,"" Roberts said. ""That's a pretty daunting consequence."" Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked, ""What about the idea that we should think about democracy, think about the right of the people to elect candidates of their choice, letting the people decide that? Because your position has the effect of disenfranchising voters to a significant degree."" Meanwhile, Jackson challenged Murray on his argument that Section 3 applies to presidents. ""Why didn't they put the word president in the very enumerated list in section three? The thing that really is troubling to me is I totally understand your argument, but they were listing people that were barred and ‘president’ is not there. And so, I guess that just makes me worry that maybe they weren't focusing on the president."" One point the justices did not focus on: whether Trump, through his words or actions, bore responsibility for the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Legal experts said the justices have a few options. The likeliest would be for a majority to overturn the Colorado decision on the argument that states cannot act individually to disqualify a presidential candidate. One way to do this would be to rule that Congress has the sole authority to implement Section 3 of the 14th Amendment by passing a law, something it hasn’t done since the amendment was ratified. Another option would be to overturn Colorado’s decision based on a different argument — such as that Trump didn’t take part in an ""insurrection,"" the word used in the 14th Amendment, or that the president wasn’t envisioned by the drafters as being subject to the amendment. But Mark Graber, University of Maryland law professor, and other legal experts said that option is unlikely because the justices likely would prefer to avoid detailed efforts to frame implementation of the 14th Amendment, because that would set a far-reaching precedent. The other options would be allowing Colorado’s disqualification to stand, or declaring Trump disqualified everywhere. But that seems unlikely based on justices’ comments in court. Graber said he ""would not be surprised"" to see a decision within two weeks, and others agreed.

Sen. Chris Murphy said ‘the border never closes.’ What does that mean?,"February 7, 2024",Samantha Putterman,"Immigration, National","Republican lawmakers who oppose a new bipartisan Senate immigration bill are using the words of one of the bill’s sponsors to bolster their opposition. During a Feb. 6 news conference, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., held up an X post, blown up on a poster board, written by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. ""You can see this with Chris Murphy's tweet,"" Scott said, pointing to the board for the cameras. One line was highlighted: ""The border never closes."" ""Chris Murphy was very candid,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said during the same press conference. ""You know, they say in Washington a gaffe is when a politician accidentally tells the truth. Well there you go, Chris Murphy: ‘the border never closes’ the Democrats' opening position is, ‘We will not close the border.’"" What did Murphy mean? On Feb. 4, the day the bill was released, Murphy posted a thread on X explaining the legislation. One post said: ""A requirement the President to funnel asylum claims to the land ports of entry when more than 5,000 people cross a day. The border never closes, but claims must be processed at the ports. This allows for a more orderly, humane asylum processing system."" PolitiFact has fact-checked, and rated False, claims that the bill allows 5,000 migrants to enter illegally every day. The legislation gives the Biden administration the Biden administration emergency authority to bar most asylum seekers if border officials record an average of 5,000 encounters a day. Encounters, however, track the number of times officials stop people trying to enter, not the number of people released into the country. Murphy worked to clarify what he meant when he said the border ""never"" closes in a subsequent post, replying to Cruz, who had said Murphy was bragging about the bill being an ""open borders victory."" Murphy wrote: ""Uh there's $2 BILLION a day in trade that crosses the border. Our economy would die if we ‘closed the border.’ We should control the border (which our bill does), not close it."" Murphy’s press office told PolitiFact that the bill’s border emergency authority would not  affect trade and lawful international travel for U.S. citizens and authorized residents and that ports of entry would remain open for asylum seekers. The bill’s ""emergency authority"" provision allows the president and Homeland Security secretary to suspend asylum for those crossing illegally into the U.S. between ports of entry. But it preserves access for people to apply for asylum at official ports of entry, such as international airports, seaports and road and rail crossing on a land border, with a cap of 1,400 applications per day. Migrants currently have this option, but because these locations typically have limited space and require appointments with long backlogs, many try to cross into the U.S. illegally between ports of entry. Meanwhile, the authority’s effectiveness would still hinge on available resources and Mexico’s cooperation accepting non-Mexican nationals deported by the U.S., experts previously told PolitiFact. ""Given the limited avenues for lawful admission into the United States, there will always be some noncitizens who seek to enter unlawfully,’"" said Kevin Johnson, dean at the University of California’s school of law. ""Absent extreme measures (such as those employed in the old East Germany to halt efforts to leave the country) that are inconsistent with our values and Constitution, the border cannot simply be shut down."" PolitiFact previously reported that current immigration law enables presidents to stop entries. But that same law also says that people can come to U.S. borders and ask for asylum, even if they enter without authorization. Immigration experts said that although the president's power is broad, it can’t be used to override other parts of immigration law.

"As Chinese immigration to U.S. rises, Republicans and Trump use ‘military age men’ scare tactic","February 7, 2024",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"Immigration, National, China","Following an increase in the number of Chinese immigrants crossing the U.S. southern border, former President Donald Trump and other Republicans have said that these are ""military age men"" with ties to China’s military or allegiance to the Communist Party of China. ""From China, they had 28,000 people in the last few months, 28,000,"" Trump said in a Feb. 4 interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News. ""That's — what's he doing, building an army? And they were mostly men, almost all men from the age of 18 to 25. So what's that all about?"" Trump did not specify who the ""he"" was, but it could have been China’s President Xi Jinping, based on Trump’s full comments. Bartiromo asked Trump, ""Are they being directed by the Communist Party to come here?"" Trump replied, ""I believe so."" Other Republican lawmakers and pundits have recently made similar comments about ""military age men"" and immigrants from China or other countries, including Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn, Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and conservative pundit Charlie Kirk. Some political figures have used the phrase ""military age men"" about immigrants without singling out China. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in a floor speech described immigrants as ""military aged,"" saying, ""These are not huddled masses of families seeking refuge and asylum."" All of these comments are misleading. U.S. Customs and Border Protection does not release specific age or gender data about immigrants at the border, and ""military age"" means different things in different countries. We found no evidence such as news reports, anecdotes or government data showing that immigrants from China are coming to the U.S. at the direction of China’s military. Chinese immigrants are coming to the U.S. in search of jobs and freedom — the same forces driving other immigrants who come to the U.S. from all over the world. Immigration attorneys and advocates told us that a significant portion are young men, but that’s not unusual for any immigrant group. The same claim that Chinese immigrants are equivalent to an invasion has circulated on social media since at least last year; we rated it False in May 2023. Despite the uptick in the number of Chinese immigrants encountered at the border, they still make up a small portion of all border encounters, according to immigration data. Immigrants from Latin American countries such as Venezuela and Mexico have had substantially more encounters with border authorities. Border officials’ encounters with Chinese immigrants at U.S. borders have risen steadily over the past three years, but surged in fiscal year 2023, the 12-month period that ended in September. In that year, border authorities encountered Chinese immigrants more than 52,000 times at U.S. borders. In each of the previous three years, the annual number hovered below 30,000. In the first three months of fiscal year 2024, there have been 23,027 encounters with Chinese immigrants, nearly as many as all of fiscal year 2022. Most Chinese migrants who reach the southern border are adults traveling alone, according to CBP data. However, the data does not disclose the age or gender of people stopped at the border. CBP separates encounters data into adults traveling alone, families with children and unaccompanied children. The Associated Press reported that Chinese immigrants are flying to Ecuador as a starting point for their journeys to the U.S. because Ecuador does not require a visa. They spend thousands of dollars on travel and then cross the Darien Gap connecting Colombia with Panama. Xiaosheng Huang, a Las Vegas immigration lawyer who mostly represents Chinese immigrants, said the immigrants coming to his firm are mostly males ages 25 to 40 because ""they are strong enough to weather the risks along the way."" Young people also are skilled at using social media to find information about how, when and where to cross the U.S. southern border. Chinese for Affirmative Action, a decades-old California-based group that protects the civil and political rights of Chinese Americans, spoke with about 100 Chinese migrants on a recent trip to the border, spokesperson Sin Yen Ling said. The organization said that 81.3% of migrants they talked to were men, and most were ages 35 to 54. Staff have also reported talking with Chinese migrants who migrated with multiple generations, including grandparents and children. Ling said she views the term ""military age men"" as fear-mongering. ""Military age"" means different things in different countries with varying requirements for military service. In China, there is no compulsory military service. Men from China crossing the border typically lack formal military training, Ling said, unlike people from countries that require all men to join the military. Immigration lawyers and advocates say many factors have driven larger numbers of people in China to emigrate to the U.S. Ling pointed to economics. China’s unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds hit 21.3% in June; after that, the government stopped releasing the numbers. Xi’s ""recent crackdown on industries such as tech, real estate, and education where young people have traditionally sought jobs have contributed to the high unemployment rate,"" Ling said. China’s gross domestic product grew in 2023, but it has been showing signs of strain. Strict policies and lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic also drove emigration when China eased its restrictions, which happened later than most other countries. A decrease in legal avenues for Chinese people to migrate to the U.S., high asylum success rates for Chinese immigrants and an inability to be deported from the U.S. also likely contribute to increased Chinese migration at the southern border. The number of U.S. visas issued to Chinese nationals has been dropping since 2015 but plunged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The visa numbers have been increasing in the past few years but still haven’t reached pre-pandemic levels. This is partly a result of fraught diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China, and it leaves crossing the southern border in search of asylum as one of the most feasible options for Chinese migrants.  People from China have a much higher success rate for getting asylum in the U.S. than people from other countries, according to data from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. Even when Chinese people are denied asylum, the U.S. government can’t easily deport them, because China doesn’t accept its nationals who have been deported from the U.S. This can serve as another incentive for Chinese immigration as people cannot be indefinitely detained by U.S. immigration authorities and therefore must be released into the U.S. when they cannot be returned to their home countries. ""Effective returns are the cornerstone of a functional and credible migration system,"" the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute wrote in December 2022. ""If irregular migrants face little risk of deportation, they have less reason to comply with orders to leave voluntarily."" Still, there’s no evidence the uptick in Chinese migration at the border is because of a directive from the Chinese Communist Party. And ""there is nothing unusual about migrants from any country being ‘military age,’"" Adam Isacson, director for defense oversight at Washington Office on Latin America, a group that advocates for human rights in the Americas, told PolitiFact in 2023. He added that it’s not unusual for people to flee persecution from countries that have poor relationships with the U.S. Clayton Dube, senior fellow at the University of Southern California U.S.-China Institute, said he has seen no proof that Chinese migrants are coming to the U.S. ""motivated by anything other than individual desire to forge new lives in the U.S."" RELATED: No evidence that Chinese immigrants at U.S. southern border are ‘troops’ RELATED: Ask PolitiFact: Does the Chinese Communist Party own U.S. land?

Lawmakers in 2018 raised the purchase age to 21 following revelations that Stoneman Douglas shooter Nikolas Cruz had legally purchased the AR-15-style weapon he used in the attack. Tony Montalto, whose 14-year-old daughter Gina was killed in the shooting, testified against lowering the age. ""Our current law is working,"" he said during a Jan. 30 Criminal Justice Subcommittee hearing in Tallahassee. ""I implore each of you to remember that law is written in the blood of the victims, including my beautiful daughter, Gina."" Jayden D’Onofrio, 19, also spoke against the bill, recalling that he was in middle school nearby when Cruz attacked the high school. ""Consider the facts,"" D’Onofrio said, ""18-to-20-year-olds are three times more likely to commit gun homicides."" Several speakers repeated D’Onofrio’s claim before the subcommittee advanced H.B. 1223 along party lines, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. (It has one more committee before it can be heard on the House floor.) We wondered: Does data show the age cohort having that high of a propensity to fatally use firearms against others? And if so, why? Crime data in the United States is notoriously incomplete, but experts agreed that general trends from state and FBI data show people ages 18 to 20 — and in many datasets people in their early-to-mid 20s — are likelier to commit deadly shootings than other age groups. Gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety said in a June fact sheet that ""data show that 18-to-20-year-olds commit gun homicides at triple the rate of adults 21 and older."" The group’s media office said researchers arrived at that calculation using the FBI’s supplementary homicide report and the U.S. Census American Community Survey from 2016 to 2020. Everytown’s researchers said they considered variables in the FBI data, including crime type, weapon and offender’s age. Researchers then used census population data to estimate each age group’s rates of committing a fatal shooting. (In most datasets, ""firearms"" includes both long guns and handguns.) Federal law requires people to be 21 to buy handguns, but some states permit buying long guns as young as 18. Florida’s law, and the proposed bill, is centered on long guns, which include rifles, carbines, shotguns and submachine guns. The AR-15 semi-automatic rifle falls under this category. After an 18-year-old shot and killed 21 people at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, in May 2022, Cassandra Crifasi, research and policy director at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, discussed how much likelier people in that age group are to commit violent acts. ""We know that 18-to-20-year-olds have some of the highest risk for gun homicide perpetration, so this is a risky group when they have firearms,"" Crifasi said. ""But very few states have done anything to address gun access among this age group."" Jeff Asher, a data analyst with expertise in evaluating criminal justice data, looked at data from Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Supplementary Homicide Report. The report’s 2020 figures (the most recent year with complete data) showed that 18-to-20-year-olds were identified as perpetrators in fatal shootings at ""three times the rate of 16-year-olds"" and about ""three times the rate of a person in their 30s,"" he said. They were the offenders at nearly twice the rate of people in their 20s, Asher found. Daniel Webster, distinguished research scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, told PolitiFact that FBI data on murders and nonnegligent manslaughters that he has studied over the years show 18 as the peak age for homicide offenders, followed closely by 19 and 20. In 2021, about 81% of homicides involved firearms, according to Pew Research Center. ""It's not a direct measure, precisely, but it's a pretty darn good proxy,"" Webster said. James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminology professor who has maintained a database on U.S. homicides dating back to 1976, said he’s found that the rate of gun homicides starts to increase around age 14, and peaks around age 20. Fox looked at homicide data from 2016 to 2020 and found that 18-to-20-year-olds comprise 4% of the U.S. population, but commit 17% of gun homicides and 16% of gun homicides by rifle. ""Gun homicides are particularly youth-dominated,"" Fox said. ""I would like to see the age (for purchasing firearms) be 25, which would be consistent with the data and what we know about brain development. At least, it should be the same as handguns, which is 21."" The human brain doesn’t finish developing until people are in their mid-to-late 20s. The prefrontal cortex, the brain region responsible for executive control, including skills such as planning, prioritizing and making well-reasoned decisions, is one of the last parts to mature. Criminologists, gun researchers and health policy experts have long said that this lack of development is a primary driver of impulsive behavior among young people. Laws that raised the legal drinking age for alcohol to 21, they said, arose out of data that showed there was inherent riskiness in allowing 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds easy access to alcohol. ""People that age can be impulsive, impatient and imprudent, and will often make actions without fully thinking about the consequences for themselves, much less their victims,"" Fox said. The time period is key. The structure of high school is gone, Webster said, presenting a transitional period in which many people in this age group can act in dangerous, impulsive ways. It’s also cultural, he said, as the vast majority of gun homicides are committed by young men who are often trying to demonstrate that they aren’t weak, and are willing to be violent. ""You've got cultural reasons, you’ve got biological reasons, you've got changing social positions,"" Webster said. ""All of this makes this group far more vulnerable to doing really dangerous things."" PolitiFact Copy Chief Matthew Crowley contributed to this report.

"Taylor Swift: Singer, songwriter, psyop? How conservative pundits spread a wild theory","February 2, 2024",Madison Czopek,"Pop Culture, PunditFact","State the obvious: Celebrities often endorse political candidates. You wouldn’t know that from recent chatter in conservative circles online and on TV that have added ""psyop"" to singer Taylor Swift’s lengthy résumé. (Psyop is shorthand for psychological operation.) The prospect of Swift endorsing President Joe Biden a second time has sent some allies of former President Donald Trump down a conspiratorial rabbit hole about a Democratic plot involving Swift. Other iterations of the theory claim Swift’s romance with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce — and his team’s upcoming appearance in Super Bowl LVIII — is orchestrated to benefit Democrats. Examples include: Conservative activist Jack Posobiec said Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, ""tried to warn us about the Taylor Swift psyop and we didn’t listen."" Former Republican congressional candidate Laura Loomer, who has spread other conspiracy theories, said that the 8-year-old daughter of former Biden press secretary Jen Psaki rooting for the Kansas City Chiefs proved ""the Democrats’ Taylor Swift election interference psyop."" Conservative activist Benny Johnson jeered at news organizations’ efforts to rebut the falsehood. ""Nothing says ‘Taylor Swift is not a psy-op’ like every major Corporate News show parroting the same talking points about her at once,"" he wrote. Those examples were just from the past week; suspicion about Swift’s role in a plot to distract Americans or help Biden has been simmering for months in fringe online forums. In early January, Fox News host Jesse Watters devoted a segment to promoting the Swift-psyop conspiracy theory, using supervillain-esque imagery and omitting important context. Watters’ primetime segment laid the groundwork for more mainstream conspiratorial commentary after Swift’s January appearances at Kelce’s playoff games.  Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift walk together Jan. 28, 2024, after the American Football Conference championship game between the Chiefs and the Baltimore Ravens, in Baltimore. (AP) ""You’ve got Taylor Swift herself,"" said Whitney Phillips, a University of Oregon assistant professor of digital platforms and media ethics who researches conspiratorial belief and identity. ""You’ve got the connection to the NFL, which just adds additional energy. You’ve got the fact that we’re approaching the 2024 election. You have the fact that Kelce was in those COVID vaccine commercials."" Any one of those things could dominate a news cycle. Combined, Phillips said, it’s a cultural ""perfect storm."" Before Watters’ segment aired, speculation about Swift’s potential as a government operative was fodder for discussion on X and podcasts. In June, the hosts of the podcast ""Macrodosing"" questioned whether Swift’s brief relationship with musician Matty Healy was orchestrated to cover up the existence of aliens. (A former military officer went public with claims that the U.S. government possessed nonhuman spacecraft). ""We started this out kind of joking around about the Taylor Swift thing,"" said host Eric Sollenberger, also known as PFT Commenter. ""Is Taylor Swift — is she a CIA asset? … What better way to distract America from finding out about aliens than having just Taylor Swift announce that she got dumped?"" Some of the ""Macrodosing"" hosts acknowledged the theory’s outlandishness and laughed at themselves. Others were more serious about how Swift, who endorsed Biden in 2020 with a tray of cookies, could be used in the 2024 election. On National Voter Registration Day in September, Swift encouraged her Instagram followers to register to vote. Vote.org reported 35,000 registrations that day, up from 25,000 on the same day in 2022. This action fed conspiracy theories. Mike Benz — a former State Department official under Trump who NBC News reported was once a content creator associated with white nationalists — shared a headline in September about Swift’s activism, writing on X: ""I told you Taylor Swift was going to be wielded as instrument of statecraft…"" Benz had previously pushed the ""statecraft"" idea on his social media accounts. Benz, who has more than 140,000 X followers, saw more evidence of government interference after a Dec. 2 opinion piece in The Hill discussed how Swift could ""save Joe Biden.""  Taylor Swift performs Nov. 9, 2023, at the Monumental stadium during her Eras Tour concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina. (AP) Swift stayed in the headlines as she attended Kelce’s games in fall and took her ""Eras"" tour to Argentina and Brazil in November. In December, Time magazine named her ""Person of the Year."" Former Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller wrote Dec. 6 on X, ""What’s happening with Taylor Swift is not organic."" Early in his Jan. 9 broadcast, Watters flashed onscreen an edited photo of Swift with red lasers for eyes. Watters, who took over former Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s evening slot in July, speculated that Swift’s popularity isn’t tied to her musical talent.  (Screenshot from Internet Archive) ""Well around four years ago, the Pentagon psychological operations unit floated turning Taylor Swift into an asset during a NATO meeting,"" Watters said. ""What kind of asset? A psyop for combating online misinformation."" He aired a clip of data engineer Alicia Marie Bargar saying at a conference almost five years ago that ""social influence can help encourage or promote behavior change."" Bargar, who then worked as a research engineer at Johns Hopkins’ Applied Physics Laboratory, mentioned Swift as an example, because she is ""a fairly influential online person."" Watters cut in, saying, ""‘Primetime’ obviously has no evidence"" that Swift is a ""front for a covert political agenda."" But he continued, mentioning Swift’s voter-registration efforts and that her relationship with Kelce had boosted the NFL’s ratings. ""So, how’s the psyop going?""  Bargar told Business Insider that her comment came from the 2019 International Conference on Cyber Conflict organized by NATO’s cyber defense hub — and that Watters took it out of context. Swift was ""an incidental example of a famous person to explain a social network analysis concept to the audience,"" Bargar said. ""This is a commonly used approach in academia to make theoretical concepts easier to understand."" In the full clip, Bargar discussed ways to counter covert influence campaigns. Because one way involved training influential people to spread desired messages, she mentioned Swift, who had shared a photo of herself next to a voting sign. Bargar said that U.S. celebrities regularly post pictures of themselves voting to encourage others to vote, a strategy that ""has a measurable effect"" on turnout. Bargar went on to explain other methods for countering influence campaigns without mentioning Swift. Bargar told Business Insider she has no affiliation with NATO or the Pentagon. ""Taylor Swift is not part of a DOD psychological operation. Period,"" Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told PolitiFact Feb. 2. ""I’m sure she has other chief priorities, as do we."" PolitiFact reached out to Bargar and Swift’s spokesperson, but did not hear back. Watters was the main amplifier of the Swift-as-psyop conspiracy theory, said NewsGuard senior analyst Macrina Wang. NewsGuard tracks online misinformation and produces weekly ""Reality Check"" reports. Data from NewsGuard’s media monitoring tools showed a 13,000% increase in online mentions of ""Taylor Swift"" and ""psyop"" from Jan. 8 to Jan. 10 — the day after Watters’ Jan. 9 show, Wang said. That included mentions on X, Reddit, websites, blogs, news sites and forums — largely excluding mentions that aimed to debunk the idea. When Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs beat the Baltimore Ravens on Jan. 28 in the American Football Conference championship game, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, shared ""wild speculation"" that the Super Bowl would be rigged for Kelce’s team ahead of a ""major presidential endorsement coming from an artificially culturally propped-up couple this fall."" Days later on X, Benz scrutinized Swift’s use of emojis and punctuation — a behavior not so different from Swifties on the prowl for Easter eggs — to speculate that the conspiracy dated back years. He said it appeared Swift had been ""handed"" language critical of Trump ahead of the 2020 election.  Phillips said she sees conservative commentators’ efforts to target Swift as an attempt to ""grab the cultural microphone."" They are essentially arguing that Swift ""is a form of liberal propaganda"" who might mobilize people to vote for Democrats and ""take away the voices of Republicans,"" Phillips said. ""Taylor Swift is just a perfect opportunity to make that argument and make it loud and make it so that people can’t help but write articles about it,"" she said. Wang said that media scrutiny and fact-checks seemed to encourage proponents of the Swift theory to dig in their heels. ""It comes from this systemic distrust of media and the establishment … and it’s almost like a badge of honor that people are trying to debunk the claim,"" Wang said.

What could a Taylor Swift endorsement mean for voter turnout in the 2024 election?,"February 2, 2024",Louis Jacobson,Elections,"The expected presidential rematch between two men, ages 77 and 81, is a fight over many things: How to protect the border; foreign aid to Israel and Ukraine; abortion access. And now, the potential for a 34-year-old superstar’s endorsement. Last fall, Taylor Swift encouraged her more than 270 million Instagram followers to register to vote, leading to a surge in registrations. Now Swift’s political influence is getting renewed attention amid a freakout among conservative media that she could endorse Joe Biden this year and lead her fans to tip the election in his direction. One unnamed source close to former President Donald Trump said top Trump allies will plot a ""holy war"" if Swift endorses Biden, Rolling Stone reported. But it is misguided to assume that Swift’s potential involvement in the race would be a magic bullet with guaranteed results. Experts say it often takes more than a single message or action for celebrity endorsements to move the needle in elections. And younger people could be particularly hard to sway because they consistently chalk up the lowest turnout rates at the polls. An endorsement would draw attention, but her fans already lean left. Swift, who registered to vote in 2008, largely avoided politics until 2018, when she endorsed Democrat Phil Bredesen in Tennessee’s U.S.Senate race against then-Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican. In a 2020 documentary about Swift, ""Miss Americana,"" she said she regretted that she didn’t speak out against Trump in 2016. Trump lashed out about Swift’s Bredesen endorsement, saying he liked her music ""about 25% less now."" Blackburn defeated Bredesen — a widely respected two-term governor — by double digits. In August 2020, Swift alluded to Trump’s attacks on mail voting during the pandemic and told her fans to ""request a ballot early and vote early."" She endorsed Biden in October 2020. But many of her social media posts are nonpartisan, encouraging fans to register and vote but not specifying a party to support. ""Are you registered to vote yet?"" Swift wrote on Instagram Sept. 19, National Voter Registration Day. ""I’ve been so lucky to see so many of you guys at my US shows recently. I’ve heard you raise your voices, and I know how powerful they are. Make sure you’re ready to use them in our elections this year! Register to vote in less than 2 minutes at Vote.org/NVRD."" Swift is not officially affiliated with the Vote.org nonprofit organization. The day that Swift posted that message, Vote.org received about 35,000 new registrations, up from 25,000 the same day in 2022. Two-thirds of those 2023 registrations were people ages 18 to 29. Swift’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about whether Swift plans to continue to encourage registration or endorse Biden. Registering thousands of new voters suggests that additional votes will be cast, since in most places the first step to voting is registering, said Jonathan Nagler, co-director of New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics. Being a registered voter can lead to more extensive outreach from campaigns and organizations that use lists of registered voters for get-out-the-vote efforts, said Alberto Medina, spokesperson for the Center for Information and Research Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, which tracks youth voting. ""Our research has found that youth who hear from campaigns and candidates, especially multiple times per cycle, are more likely to vote,"" Medina said, adding that, ""given Swift’s massive cultural footprint, her potential impact could be unprecedented."" ""But research suggests it may take more than a single message or action,"" he said. A fall poll of about 2,100 18- to 29-year-olds by the Harvard Institute of Politics asked whether respondents would be more likely to vote if they received a call or text from Swift encouraging them to do so. Nearly two-thirds said it would make no difference, 19% said it would make them more likely to vote, and 15% said it would make them less likely to vote. Swift’s fans, however, span all age groups. According to a Morning Consult poll of adults, 45% of ""avid"" Swift fans are millennials aged 27 to 42. Another 11% are in Generation Z, who were born between 1997 and 2012. The remainder is split about evenly between baby boomers and Generation X. (That poll was conducted in early March, and Morning Consult wrote, ""Swift has not yet earned the admiration of many Gen Zers, but perhaps her ‘Eras’ tour can change that."") Swift’s 2024 influence could be greater than in 2020 when she endorsed Biden. Since then, she has released multiple albums and generated skyrocketing demand and publicity with her Eras Tour. When it comes to juicing younger voter turnout, the main way Swift could have an impact is among independent voters who are fans, said Wayne P. Steger, a DePaul University political science professor. Independents ""do not have the same party allegiances and, if they pay attention to political news, can be swayed,"" Steger said. ""There may well be people who do not have a particularly strong partisan attachment and who do not pay attention to politics normally, but who do pay attention to Taylor Swift."" Mary-Kate Lizotte, an Augusta University political science professor, said Swift’s comments about politics will influence her fans and followers, as we’ve seen already, but are unlikely to influence people who are not already fans or who are her fans but are politically conservative. ""Her endorsement, however, will result in a different type of media attention to the Biden campaign, which could also be advantageous,"" said Lizotte, who has researched gender differences in political opinion. ""Having more young and millennial women register, turnout and vote for Biden would be beneficial for the Biden ticket. Her endorsement is not likely to change anyone’s mind on who to vote for or to even influence undecided voters. But increasing registration and turnout among women who would already be likely to vote for Biden, would help the Biden ticket."" Swift could inspire some young people to vote, but it’s an uphill task: People ages 18 to 29 consistently have lower turnout rates — as much as 25 to 30 percentage points lower in recent presidential elections than the rate for people 60 and older. Observing a liberal bent among younger voters — who have favored Democrats by 7 to 13 percentage points in presidential elections since 2008 — some Republican lawmakers have sought to enact barriers to voting. The Kentucky Senate in January backed a bill that would remove student IDs as a primary proof of identification at the polls. Idaho in 2023 banned the use of student IDs for voter ID. In Texas, laws created new obstacles to establishing early voting sites on college campuses. All three states have Republican majorities in their state legislatures. Research suggests that celebrities can sometimes influence voter choice, but it doesn’t happen in every election. Celebrities may have more influence in primaries, when voters are choosing among candidates who have broadly similar ideologies. Moving the needle in a general election, when the differences between nominees are more pronounced, has more to do with voter motivation. For example, in 2016, Hillary Clinton received multiple celebrity endorsements including George Clooney, Beyoncé and Jay-Z . Many of Clinton’s endorsements came during the general election, but she still lost to Trump. By comparison, one research paper concluded that Oprah Winfrey’s 2008 endorsement of Barack Obama resulted in approximately 1 million votes for him in the Democratic primary. David J. Jackson, a Bowling Green State University political scientist, surveyed Ohio voters in 2016 and asked whether a particular endorsement would influence their vote. Some potential celebrity endorsements he floated produced negative results, but Jackson said his research showed that selective use of endorsements with certain targeted audiences might have an impact. For example, rocker Ted Nugent supported Trump. Jackson’s research indicated that although overall Nugent’s endorsement produced negative results, voters aligned with the tea party movement indicated that they would be positively influenced by it. Morning Consult found in a March 2023 survey that 55% of Swift fans identified as Democrats, and the remainder were evenly split between Republicans and independents. How much Swift does to promote Biden’s candidacy will play a major role, political experts say. Jackson said the power of a Swift endorsement would depend on whether it’s a one-off social media post versus multiple appearances with Biden. ""There are lots of reasons why people do things, but one basic reason is because someone they like and trust asked them to do it,"" Jackson said. If people like and trust Swift, he said, ""then the more often and vigorously she supports Biden (if she does),"" the more likely it is to have an effect.

Ask PolitiFact: Can Joe Biden ‘shut down the border’ on his own?,"February 2, 2024",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"Immigration, Border Security, Ask PolitiFact","President Joe Biden says he has done everything under his authority to try to reduce illegal immigration at the U.S. southern border, and that he’ll be able to do more once Congress passes a new bill. But Republicans disagree. Biden said Jan. 26 that he’s waiting for a bipartisan bill being negotiated in the Senate to give him more resources and ""a new emergency authority to shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed."" Although the bill’s text remains under wraps, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says Biden doesn’t need new authority to decrease illegal border crossings. Immigration law and recent Supreme Court precedents already give Biden the authority to secure the border, Johnson said in a Jan. 27 X post. So, who’s right? Is there more Biden can do? Or is it on Congress to update immigration law, which hasn’t been changed in decades? In his X post, Johnson quoted section 212(f) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which says a president may ""suspend the entry"" of or impose restrictions ""he may deem to be appropriate"" if someone’s entry ""would be detrimental to the interests of the United States."" Johnson has a point that the law gives the president the ability to stop entries. But immigration experts say there’s more to it: That same immigration law also says people can come to U.S. borders and ask for asylum, even if they cross into the U.S. without authorization. Former President Donald Trump invoked the section of immigration law that Johnson cited when he tried to block people from seeking asylum. But courts stopped his efforts because they were at odds with the immigration law’s asylum section. Immigration experts told PolitiFact that although the power vested by section 212(f) is broad, it can’t be used to override other parts of immigration law. Many administrations have used that authority, to varying success. Trump invoked the provision more than two dozen times, including to temporarily ban the entry of citizens from mainly Muslim-majority countries. After multiple versions of the ban, the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately allowed Trump to carry out this executive order, saying that the order did not conflict with immigration law. But Trump failed when he tried using this authority to stop illegal immigration, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, an immigrant-rights advocacy group. In November 2018, Trump invoked the provision to deny asylum to people who illegally enter the U.S. between ports of entry at the southern border. A federal judge temporarily blocked this effort, saying Trump’s executive order ""irreconcilably conflicts"" with immigration law. The law says people must be physically present in the U.S. to seek asylum, regardless of their immigration status or how they entered. An appeals court sided with the lower court, and the Supreme Court denied Trump’s request to block the appeals court’s ruling. ""No president has the authority to simply shut the border to migrants,"" Reichlin-Melnick said. The travel ban legal precedent is different from the illegal immigration situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a Migration Policy Institute policy analyst. With the travel ban, the court was dealing with people who were outside the United States. With the southern border, people already on U.S. soil are allowed to seek asylum. Although 212(f) ""does, on its face, give sweeping powers to the President,"" that power ""does not and cannot operate in isolation from our other domestic and international legal obligations,"" said Lindsay Harris, the International Human Rights Clinic director at the University of San Francisco. Asylum law provisions are ""very much in tension with efforts to ‘shut down’ the border,"" Harris said. ""Closing the border arguably would violate"" domestic and international asylum laws, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University immigration law professor. Johnson on X listed other actions he said Biden could take to reduce the number of immigrants coming illegally into the country. But Biden is already using several of those mechanisms. The problem is that immigration officials ""cannot keep up with demand, which speaks to the need for increased avenues for legal immigration,"" including family and job sponsorships, Bush-Joseph said. Johnson’s list included: Expedited removal: Biden is using it to quickly deport people who arrive at the southern border. However, people can be exempt from expedited removal if they can prove a credible fear of returning to their home country and therefore apply for asylum. Mandatory and discretionary detention: Biden is also using this, allowing immigration officials to decide which migrants to detain and release while they await court hearings. There is not enough detention space to detain all migrants who reach the border. Ending ""catch and release"": The political term refers to immigration authorities stopping and releasing immigrants so they can await their court hearings outside of federal custody. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have followed this practice for decades (including the Trump administration), because there’s limited detention space. Reinstating the ""Remain in Mexico"" program: The Trump policy required certain asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while awaiting their U.S.-based asylum court hearings. Biden ended the program. Mexico in February 2023 said it would not agree to the program restarting. Bush-Joseph said that adding more asylum officers and judges could help alleviate the border situation. Biden said he’s requested congressional funding for 1,300 additional Border Patrol agents, 375 immigration judges and 1,600 asylum officers. Despite any effort by Congress or the Biden administration to mitigate illegal immigration, there are larger issues that will still drive people to U.S. borders, experts say. Violence in other countries, political persecution and climate change-related displacement are some of those factors, Harris said. ""The U.S. is simply not immune to global increases in forced migration,"" she said. RELATED: Ask PolitiFact: What branch of government is ‘really’ responsible for the crisis at the border?"
Explaining Ron DeSantis’ effort to call a convention of states and amend the US Constitution,"February 1, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"Congress, Constitutional Amendments, Legal Issues, Florida","He dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, but Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who had pushed to ""make America Florida,"" is still aiming to shape national policy. DeSantis is proposing an alternative method of proposing U.S. Constitutional amendments that would let states call a convention if enough of them ask Congress. In a Jan. 29 Naples news conference, DeSantis said he would ask the Republican-controlled Florida legislature to pass four resolutions that would compel Congress to call a ""convention of the states"" aimed at passing those same resolutions as constitutional amendments. ""Washington’s never going to reform itself,"" DeSantis said in the conference. ""It’s going to require us working in our individual states using the tools that the Founding Fathers gave us to be able to take power away from D.C. and return it back to the American people."" When contacted for comment, DeSantis’ office pointed to two Florida Senate measures, one calling for the balanced federal budget and the other for congressional term limits. The other two reforms, presidential line-item veto power and equal laws for the public and members of Congress. so far lack accompanying bills. If this sounds confusing, that’s because it is. Usually, a constitutional amendment is passed when Congress approves it by a two-thirds margin, then sends it to the states, where three-fourths must approve to ratify. The alternative method DeSantis advocates is also spelled out in the U.S. Constitution, which says: ""The Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which … shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof."" These guidelines would require 34 states to call a convention. Even if the Florida Legislature approves proposals, 33 other states would have to approve the same proposals to have a convention. And if those amendments were eventually approved by a convention, ratifying each one would require 38 states to concur. In the Constitution’s nearly 237-year history, such an assembly has never been called. Nevertheless, DeSantis and other conservatives see this tactic as part of a broader movement to achieve their policy goals. However, some legal scholars and advocacy groups say the method’s untested history invites problems, as does the the Constitution’s lack of guidance about how a convention would be structured and limited. The idea’s opponents fear that the convention could make radical constitutional revisions beyond its original focus. The language in the Constitution ""seems pretty simple, but lots remains entirely unclear,"" said Frank O. Bowman III, a University of Missouri law professor. Although the concept is often called a ""constitutional convention,"" or ""con-con"" for short, Robert G. Natelson, a retired University of Montana law professor and a senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Independence Institute in Denver, said the term is a misnomer, because the Constitution’s wording refers to a ""convention for proposing amendments."" Legal scholars say key aspects of how to execute the count for calling a convention remain murky. In the early 1990s, Michael Stokes Paulsen, now a University of St. Thomas law professor, determined that over time, 45 states had called for a general convention, without a specified topic. But it’s unclear whether the framers intended a convention to be so wide open. Many scholars believe states’ proposed amendments must be narrower, and tied to a specific policy topic. Backers of a balanced budget amendment say they have 28 states on board already, although the validity of some of these states’ proposals might be legally debatable, said Georgetown University law professor David Super. Even if all proposals were valid, six more states would need to join to invoke a convention. Another complicating factor is that states can rescind past resolutions that supported a convention; several states have done this in recent years. By the time Paulsen revisited this idea in 2011, the number of states calling for a convention had dropped from 45 to 33, because of repeals. That’s one less than the 34 required to invoke a convention. Issues Super said are ""completely undetermined"" include who would select the delegates, how much representation each state would have, how proposals would be grouped for voting and what kind of a majority would be necessary to approve amendments. Michigan State University law professor Brian Kalt said, ""Presumably, the legislature of each state would choose a process for selecting delegates. But there is no precedent. The delegates assembled would have to come up with their own system."" The Constitution does not spell out an explicit role for the president or the courts in organizing a convention, or a role for Congress beyond telling the convention to meet in the first place. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has tended to avoid what it deems ""political"" questions, legal experts said. Even if the Constitution clearly says Congress ""shall"" call a convention, it’s unclear who could enforce that mandate if Congress chooses not to — a realistic possibility if the amendments would reduce Congress’ institutional power. ""We just don’t know,"" said Jonathan Marshfield, a University of Florida law professor. If the convention were prompted by a specific proposed topic, such as a balanced budget amendment, it would seem to have limits. Natelson, who moderates a website about conventions like the one DeSantis is seeking, said the Constitution’s wording — a ""convention for proposing amendments"" — is noteworthy because it specifies that the existing constitution must be amended, not that an entirely new document can be introduced. Absent constitutional guidance, historical precedent, or an external enforcement mechanism, however, not everyone is sure those guardrails would hold. ""The biggest fear that people usually mention is that of the ‘runaway convention’ that starts proposing all sorts of things outside of its original remit,"" Kalt said. There’s a precedent for this — in the original Constitutional Convention of 1787. ""A fair number of delegates thought that their task was simply to propose amendments to the Articles of Confederation,"" Bowman said. ""The idea that a whole new structure should be proposed wasn't settled until after everyone arrived."" Scholars broadly agree that the concept of a convention is valuable: It was designed to act as an institutional check on Congress. If Congress is dysfunctional — as many Americans believe — a convention could be ""a lever that would push it in the right direction,"" Marshfield said. ""I see some value in that."" However, getting 38 states to agree to ratify an amendment, experts said, would be exceedingly difficult in an age of solidly red and blue state legislatures. ""The country is very polarized, and anything that doesn't have significant support in both parties doesn't have any chance of being added to the Constitution,"" Kalt said."
"What PolitiFact learned in 1,000 fact-checks of Donald Trump","February 1, 2024",Grace Abels,"National, Candidate Biography, Elections","PolitiFact has hit a milestone: We published our 1,000th rated fact-check of Donald Trump. In classic Trump fashion, he claimed in his New Hampshire primary victory speech Jan. 23 that Democrats used the COVID-19 pandemic to ""cheat"" in the 2020 presidential election. Unsurprisingly to our regular readers, his claim was Pants on Fire. It's not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or make stuff up. But American fact-checkers have never encountered a politician who shares Trump’s disregard for factual accuracy. Our fact-checking saga of Trump began in 2011, when he used his celebrity to amplify ""birther"" conspiracy theories to undermine former President Barack Obama’s eligibility. The pace of our checks intensified in 2015, with his surprise Republican primary ascent and his 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton. Trump’s turbulent policy-by-Twitter updates kept our reporters sprinting during his presidential tenure. He downplayed the COVID-19 public health threat and fanned persistent falsehoods about voting and election results that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump’s fast-and-loose style surely endears him to some of his supporters, who propelled him to the White House in 2016 and made him the Republican front-runner to challenge President Joe Biden in 2024. The 45th president stands apart — and the election year has barely started. Here's what our fact-checking data shows us about his Truth-O-Meter record so far. It will be some time before another politician hits 1,000 ratings. After Trump, our three most-fact-checked politicians are all Democrats: former President Barack Obama with 603 fact-checks, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton with 301, and President Joe Biden with 286. Trump stands alone for the share of rated claims that are some degree of false. About 76% of his statements earned ratings of Mostly False, False or Pants on Fire. The median rating for his 1,000 checks is False. More than 18% of our fact-checks of Trump landed at Pants on Fire, which we define as a statement that is not just false but ridiculous. About a quarter of Trump’s 1,000 rated statements landed on the relatively true side of our meter (True, Mostly True or Half True). Often these involved statistics, such as his accurate tweet in 2019 that said U.S. food stamp program participation had hit a 10-year low. Trump’s median rating of False is worse than a cross-section of frequently checked Democratic and Republican politicians. Politicians with median ratings of Half True include Obama, Biden and Hillary Clinton; three senators who ran for president, Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; and two longtime congressional leaders, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Trump has also fared worse than three frequently checked politicians who have a median rating of Mostly False: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.; and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. ""It's been an astounding eight years in American politics,"" said Jennifer Mercieca, a Texas A&M University communication professor and a historian of American political rhetoric. ""He’s built his entire political identity on the fact that he doesn't owe anyone the truth about anything."" In his 1987 best-seller ""The Art of the Deal,"" Trump described ""why a little hyperbole never hurts."" ""People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole,"" Trump wrote. ""It's an innocent form of exaggeration — and a very effective form of promotion."" That approach held true for politics as it did for business. Ever since he descended the escalator at Trump Tower in 2015, we have encountered a firehose of claims. He talks a lot — in TV interviews, on social media, at campaign rallies that stretch for nearly two hours. As president, Trump made Twitter essential reading, before the social media platform exiled him after the Capitol riot. Of the tweets we checked, about 79% rated Mostly False or lower. So far, on his Truth Social platform, we have not yet rated a claim higher than Mostly False. Among his most common settings for claims, Trump fared best in State of the Union addresses. His median Truth-O-Meter rating for those annual speeches inched into the Half True range. In practice, we have looked at many more Trump statements than just the 1,000 cited in this article. Each of the 1,000 fact-checks has a formal Truth-O-Meter rating. Sometimes, we instead write articles about claims without rating them. Examples include summaries of multiple claims made in a debate, rally or major speech. Other times, a statement is a prediction, or too vague for us to rate, or involves an unanswerable question, such as how courts will rule in the classified documents case. In those cases, we’ll write an explanatory story without a rating. These are not captured in Trump’s Truth-O-Meter scorecard. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker column sought to collect every statement by Trump during his term that Glenn Kessler and his team determined was false or misleading. They ended up with 30,573 statements. Even though these mentions were usually brief rather than fully detailed fact-check articles, and even though they included many repeated claims, compiling the database was ""exhausting,"" Kessler told us. The database ended up at about 5 million words. After this experience, Kessler said the Post has capped future efforts at the first 100 days of a new presidency, as the newspaper did for Biden’s 78 false or misleading claims. If the past is prologue, 2024 will be another peak year for checking Trump. Our rated fact-checks peaked in 2016 and 2020, the two years he ran for president. For Trump’s accusations and insults, accuracy hardly matters. In 2011, Trump leveraged his TV businessman persona to discredit Obama’s legitimacy as the nation’s elected leader. Trump told an annual conservative conference that the people who went to school with Obama ""never saw him, they don't know who he is."" His accusation was part of ""birtherism,"" a series of false beliefs that Obama, the first Black president and one with Kenyan lineage, wasn’t a natural-born American citizen. We rated this statement Pants on Fire! He kept repeating birther claims through his 2015 campaign. In 2016, Trump falsely said Clinton started the rumors about Obama’s birthplace. Clinton supporters circulated the rumor in the 2008 Democratic primary’s final days and after Clinton had conceded to Obama. But the record did not show Clinton or her campaign ever promoting, or starting the birther theory. In his new campaign, Trump promoted baseless birtherism claims about Republican rival Nikki Haley, a former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor who was born on U.S. soil to immigrant parents. Sometimes it’s easy to fact-check Trump because his statements fly in the face of available video. He tweeted in 2020 that ""I never called John (McCain) a loser."" But 2015 video of Trump speaking in Ames, Iowa, showed that he said of McCain, ""I never liked him much after"" McCain lost the 2008 presidential race, ""because I don't like losers."" During a 2016 GOP primary debate, Trump said of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, that ""he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody … nobody reports that."" Bush was making a joke about what he felt was scant press coverage. We rated Trump’s statement Mostly False. We have fact-checked many politicians who admit, usually through a spokesperson, that they misspoke. When Trump is challenged on his dubious statements, he typically ignores reporters’ questions or says he shouldn’t have to defend his words. In November 2015, Trump tweeted an image that crime statistics show Black people kill 81% of white homicide victims. We rated the statistic Pants on Fire. Days later, then-Fox News host Bill O’Reilly told Trump he was wrong. ""Hey, Bill, Bill, am I gonna check every statistic?"" Trump said. ""I get millions and millions of people."" Trump is the three-time winner of our annual Lie of the Year, which we award for the year’s most significant falsehood. He won: In 2015 for three outrageous claims in the Republican presidential primary, including the claim about Black people. In 2017 for calling claims of Russian election interference a ""made-up story."" In 2019 for saying a whistleblower got his call with Ukraine’s president ""almost completely wrong"" when the account was close to the White House’s own transcript. Trump shared in our 2020 and 2021 Lies of the Year for his efforts to downplay the threat of COVID-19 and the significance of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, respectively. PolitiFact’s focus has been on Trump’s more consequential statements. His rhetoric around immigration often distorts reality.  Trump campaigned in 2015 and 2016 on a message of fear of immigrants illegally in the U.S. He told Americans that ""the Mexican government ... they send the bad ones over."" That’s Pants on Fire. Most Mexicans were crossing the border seeking work. There was no evidence that their government sent criminals. Trump also wildly misrepresented Democratic policies. In October 2016, he said Clinton would allow 650 million immigrants into the U.S. in one week. That’s an absurd number considering the U.S. population was about half that amount. In December 2017, Trump said that under the diversity visa lottery program, other countries ""give us their worst people"" — a distortion of how the U.S. government vets and selects them. During the 2020 campaign and Biden’s presidency, Trump continued to use scare tactics, falsely stating that Biden halted virtually all deportations, including of murderers, or planned to give immigrants welfare benefits.  Trump’s ridiculous statements about elections stretch back to 2016, when a few months before Election Day he called elections ""rigged."" After he won in 2016, Trump claimed there was ""serious voter fraud"" in states he lost. It was particularly absurd for him to blame voter fraud for his 2016 loss of California, a state that hadn’t voted for a Republican for president since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Trump’s election falsehoods increasingly became focused on grievances. As Trump faced reelection in 2020, he said Biden could win only if the election was rigged. Elections are administered in thousands of local areas nationwide, each with safeguards, making any attempt to ""rig"" a national election highly improbable. Trump’s election result denial has poisoned many Americans’ views on voting, misleading the public about how elections are run. A December 2023 Washington Post/University of Maryland survey found that about one third of respondents believed there was solid evidence of widespread voter fraud in 2020. Gallup found before the 2022 midterms that most Americans were very confident or somewhat confident that the results would be accurately counted. Democrats were more than twice as confident as Republicans, representing the largest gap Gallup has recorded on this measure since 2004. One week before the 2020 election, Trump said counting ballots for weeks after Election Day ""is totally inappropriate, and I don't believe that's by our laws."" However, most ballots are counted quickly; federal law allows states more than a month after the election to check their math, resolve disputes. In the early morning hours after polls closed, Trump made the ridiculously premature declaration that he had won. Because the ballots were still being counted,  no one could say with any confidence whether Trump or Biden had won. Yet claims that Trump had won prompted Trump’s supporters — some armed — to gather outside of vote counting sites including in Philadelphia and Arizona’s Maricopa County, home to Phoenix. Trump continued this theme over the next several weeks, telling his supporters of ""surprise ballot dumps"" and ""massive fraud"" that did not exist. He told his allies, ""Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!"" More than 1,200 people have been charged in the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Court records show that some have said Trump told them to act. Whether Trump faces consequences for actions to subvert lawful election results remains to be seen in Fulton County, Georgia, and the federal courts. Readers sometimes ask us what our endgame is with a politician like Trump. They say our fact-checks don’t keep Trump from repeating his false claims, including lies about the 2020 election. It’s not our job to silence Trump or force him to change his rhetoric. Nor is it our job to tell voters how they should mark their ballots. Our job is to provide factually vetted information to voters so they can make informed choices. We fact-check all major political parties, holding their leaders and candidates accountable for misleading rhetoric. We write for Americans who are open to considering evidence. And we document for the historical record, including analysts who will study the Trump era for decades to come.

These are PolitiFact's top 10 most-read fact-checks of Donald Trump,"February 1, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"National, Candidate Biography, Elections","PolitiFact has published its 1,000th fact-check of Donald Trump. In addition to our data analysis, we decided to back at the 10 Trump fact-checks that our readers clicked the most. The list included statements about immigrants, crime, terrorism, Hillary Clinton, gasoline prices and his own popularity. Here is the list in descending order: 1. ""My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011, when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months,"" Trump said in 2017. Mostly False. Trump was referring to the Obama administration’s 2011 decision to delay processing of Iraqi refugees for six months after the FBI uncovered evidence of  a failed terrorism plot by two Iraqi refugees. Trump’s executive order temporarily banned travel to the United States for all citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries and was not in response to actions by those citizens. 2. In the 2015 Republican primary, Trump tweeted an image that said crime statistics show Black people kill 81% of white homicide victims. Pants on Fire! Trump’s tweet was a day after voters at a Trump rally in Alabama kicked and punched a Black activist. Almost every number in the image was wrong — the statistics on white victims were exaggerated fivefold and the police-related deaths were also off. This image again went viral in 2020, after George Floyd, a Black man, was murdered by Minneapolis police. 3. Trump said a nuclear deal gave Iran ""$150 billion, giving $1.8 billion in cash — in actual cash carried out in barrels and in boxes from airplanes."" Half True. Trump made this statement in a 2015 ""Fox and Friends"" interview. Trump withdrew from the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal but broke his promise to renegotiate it. The $150 billion was the highest estimate we had seen, and the one with the least evidence to support it. The $1.8 billion was reasonably accurate, but we found no evidence that barrels and boxes were involved. A post shared by PolitiFact (@politifact) 4: ""The birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!"" False. Trump tweeted this statement in 2015. The birther movement refers to the falsehood that Obama was not born in the United States. The birther movement appears to have begun with Democrats who supported Clinton and opposed Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary. But there was no record that Clinton or anyone within her campaign ever advanced the charge that Obama was not born in the United States. 5. In 2015, Trump said, ""I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering"" as the World Trade Center collapsed. Pants on Fire! Trump’s statement during a speech defies basic logic. If thousands and thousands of people were celebrating the 9/11 attacks on American soil, many people beyond Trump would have remembered it, and there would be video or visual evidence. Instead, all we found were a couple of news articles that described rumors of celebrations; the rumors were either debunked or unproved. 6. In 2017, Trump tweeted, ""The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion."" Mostly False. The number was correct, but it was temporary, because of how government bond selling and cashing ebbed and flowed that month. The drop did not affect the overall arc of the national debt, which has only risen for more than two decades. Also, Trump hadn’t implemented any policies that could have triggered the temporary debt decline. 7. In 2021, Trump told interviewer Hugh Hewitt that gasoline prices were ""$1.86 when I left"" the White House. False. Some fraction of Americans may have been paying that amount, but most were not. The national average price for gasoline when Trump left the White House was $2.38, or about 28% higher than what he said it was. 8. Trump’s first-ever campaign ad in 2016 purportedly showed Mexicans swarming over ""our southern border,"" as if they were ants fleeing an anthill. Pants on Fire. PolitiFact traced the footage back to a location 5,000 miles away from the southern U.S. border. On May 3, 2014, the Italian television network RepubblicaTV had posted footage of migrants crossing the border into Melilla, one of two Spanish-held enclaves on the Moroccan coast. 9. In a 2016 speech, Trump said Hillary Clinton headed the State Department when it ""approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation."" Mostly False. Trump’s claim was a reductive version of his source material’s findings. State was one of nine agencies, plus federal and state nuclear regulators, that had to OK the deal, which had  Russia’s nuclear energy agency gain control of about 20% of U.S. uranium production capacity by gradually buying Canada-based Uranium One. Nine people related to Uranium One donated to the Clinton Foundation, but it’s unclear whether they were still involved in the company when the Russian deal happened or stood to benefit from it. Most of the Clinton Foundation donations occurred before and during Clinton’s 2008 presidential bid, before she could have known she would become secretary of state. 10. In a 2019 press conference, Trump said, ""I’ve had tremendous Republican support. I have a 90% — 94% approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That’s an all-time record."" Half True. At the time, Trump’s support within his party was consistently in the mid-to-high 80% range, but not as high as 94% RELATED: What PolitiFact learned in 1,000 fact-checks of Donald Trump RELATED: All of our fact-checks of Donald Trump RELATED: All of our fact-checks of Joe Biden"
COVID-19 vaccines’ effect on thyroid conditions requires more study,"January 26, 2024",Katelyn Ferral,Public Health,"If you’re a woman with a thyroid condition, could getting vaccinated against COVID-19 make it worse? That’s the claim in a Jan. 17 Instagram reel featuring a physical therapist who sells supplements and says the vaccine could exacerbate autoimmune or thyroid problems in people, especially women. The reel includes screenshots of scientific articles with headlines about whether there is a link between the vaccine and thyroid troubles. Text over the video reads: ""Did the vaccine make your thyroid worse?"" The short answer: The science is inconclusive about whether there’s a link between COVID-19 vaccines and worsening thyroid and autoimmune disorders. Experts told PolitiFact that no cause-and-effect relationship has been established between the two. Here’s what recent case studies have found: A 2022 case review study, published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Endocrinological Investigation, found that among 83 reported cases of thyroid disorder following COVID-19 vaccination, 68% were after vaccination with mRNA-based vaccines. ""SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been associated with very rare complications, such as thyroid disorders,"" according to the article. It also said that the vaccines’ benefits ""exceed any risk of infrequent complications such as a transient thyroid malfunction."" One 2023 review examined the case of a 50-year-old woman with no prior history of autoimmune or thyroid issues and no other health issues who reported developing a thyroid disorder after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Blood tests confirmed the thyroid condition.  ""The vaccine's mechanism of causing hypothyroidism is still being studied, but vaccines continue to improve, and the benefits outweigh the side effects,"" the study said. A separate 2023 case review said, ""The causal relationship between COVID-19 vaccines and these autoimmune diseases remains to be demonstrated."" ""There is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause thyroid disease,"" Dr. Robert H. Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said in an email statement to PolitiFact. Hopkins noted that millions of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered around the world, and serious adverse events are rare. ""There have been rare reports of thyroid conditions occurring after COVID-19 vaccination in the medical literature. … These cases were identified anywhere from a few days to several weeks after vaccination and represented many different thyroid conditions,"" he said. According to the American Thyroid Association, ""There is no evidence at this time that having thyroid disease makes you at higher risk for vaccine-related problems."" Dr. Michael McDermott, president of the American Thyroid Association and director of the University of Colorado Hospital’s endocrinology and diabetes practice, said in an email case reviews are ""are good for bringing potential issues to the forefront of discussion (hypothesis generating) but scientifically are nowhere near adequate to establish cause and effect."" He said much remains to be studied about how the COVID-19 virus and the vaccines affect thyroid disorders, McDermott said. ""Thyroid specialists are not yet able to determine the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection. … The medical/scientific community needs to evaluate each new issue as it appears and thyroid dysfunction (temporary or permanent) is no exception."""
"Razor wire and a blocked Border Patrol. What’s going on in Eagle Pass, Texas?","January 24, 2024",Jeff Cercone,"Immigration, National, Texas","Texas and the federal government are fighting each other in court over who should take charge of an area in Texas that borders Mexico. Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott argues that the Biden administration isn’t doing enough to control illegal border crossings. Abbott ordered the state’s National Guard to install razor wire along the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass, Texas. The goal: to block migrants’ path into the country. But Biden administration officials and Department of Homeland Security court filings say Texas is denying U.S. Border Patrol agents’ ability to do their jobs. The wire blocks Border Patrol from entering Shelby Park, a state park that federal agents have used to process paperwork for migrants. People who reach the wire area are already on U.S. soil. The battle has fueled social media posts that question whether a new civil war is underway. Texas’ actions restricting Border Patrol’s movements are ""quite unprecedented,"" said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas at Austin law professor. ""I’m not aware of, and Texas hasn’t identified, a prior case in which state authorities physically impeded the federal government’s access to an international border,"" Vladeck said. Despite the legal and on-the-ground disagreements, however, the Civil War comparisons don’t fit well here, immigration and legal experts told us. The landscape of mid-1800s U.S. was vastly different, they said, and federal-state conflicts before and after the war — including over fugitive slaves, school integration and taxes — are not uncommon. Although Texas’ actions may be considered aggressive, none told us they expect the dispute to go beyond the courtroom. Here’s what we know. A young girl is lifted over concertina wire as migrants who crossed the Rio Grande and entered the U.S. from Mexico head to be processed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Sept. 23, 2023, in Eagle Pass, Texas. (AP) Texas sued the Biden administration in October for cutting razor wire installed by the Texas National Guard along the Mexico border. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that the federal government ""illegally destroyed"" Texas property and ""disrupted"" Texas’ ability to stop illegal entries. But the Biden administration says Border Patrol agents need access to an area cordoned off by Texas so that they can respond to medical emergencies involving migrants. In January, after lower court appeals by both sides, the Biden administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court for an emergency decision. DHS said the Texas National Guard had added more razor wire along a 2.5-mile stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border and restricted Border Patrol’s ability to reach the Rio Grande and access to Shelby Park, an area agents use for migrant inspections. On Jan. 22, the court sided with the Biden administration in a 5-4 decision, granting its request to allow it to remove the razor wire, at least while a lawsuit plays out in lower courts. Abbott after the decision said on X that he ""will continue to defend Texas' constitutional authority to secure the border and prevent the Biden Admin from destroying our property."" CBS News reported that Texas National Guard members had begun adding additional razor wire the day after the Supreme Court decision. The battle over the blocked-off area escalated after three migrants, two of them children, drowned Jan. 12 on the Rio Grande. Two other migrants who survived were in distress on the river but Border Patrol agents could not get to them because of the blocked access, the DHS said in a lawsuit over the razor wire. Texas responded that Border Patrol agents did not request access to the migrants. States and the federal government have previously disagreed over immigration enforcement. That’s the case with dozens of states, cities and counties across the U.S. that have enacted ""sanctuary"" policies limiting their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But ""no sanctuary city has ever prevented federal immigration from coming into their territory in the same way that Texas is trying to do,"" said Huyen Pham, a Texas A&M law professor. There’s a difference between local and state governments not cooperating with federal authorities and interfering with them, said Vladeck. ""Under the U.S. Constitution, local and state governments can choose whether to help the federal government enforce federal law,"" Vladeck said. ""They can’t hinder the federal government from enforcing federal law."" A comparison between the Texas-Biden dispute and the Civil War is an imperfect one, as the relationship between the federal government and state troops is far more regulated now than it was in the 19th century, said Cecily Zander, a Texas Woman’s University assistant history professor. ""Biden has the option to supersede Gov. Abbott’s authority and federalize the Texas National Guard to compel them to move away from the border, since Texas remains in the Union,"" said Zander. That wasn’t an option for President Abraham Lincoln, Zander said, because Texas didn’t recognize the federal government’s authority in 1861, she said. States have tried to block federal action many times, before and after the Civil War, said Lorien Foote, a Texas A&M University history professor. For example, states tried to tax the national bank out of existence and northern states used state officials to defy the federal fugitive slave laws, she said. ""The conflicts of Federalism are embedded in all parts of our history in the 19th and 20th centuries,"" Foote said. Daniel Morales, a University of Houston Law Center associate professor of law, said he believes that the Texas and the Biden administration’s feud will be confined to the courtrooms, but made a Civil War analogy to describe Abbott’s actions in Texas. The best analogy, ""given the dueling military-adjacent operations, is the Battle of Fort Sumter, which started the Civil War. That’s how bellicose this action is by Governor Abbott,"" Morales said, referring to the 1861 battle in which Confederate forces attacked a South Carolina base occupied by Union forces. Morales also compared Texas’ stance with Southern states’ resitance to integration, which resulted in federal troops integrating some schools at gunpoint. ""Abbott is using state-controlled troops to defy"" federal law ""in a way, that rhymes with both historical moments,"" Morales said. Still, ""the confrontation on the Texas border is nothing close to the sectional crisis, mass political conflict, and violence that led to the Civil War,"" said Michael Parrish, a Baylor University history professor emeritus. Ultimately, the courts will decide whether Texas’ actions are legal and whether the federal government has superseding authority on immigration matters. The cases may ultimately end up back at the Supreme Court. Pham said the current, more conservative Supreme Court might be open to some things Texas wants, such as arresting immigrants for state-based crimes, but not to blocking the Border Patrol from accessing the border. That ""seems like such a direct challenge to a really bedrock principle of immigration federalism that I think even this court would be reluctant to allow,"" Pham said."
"After New Hampshire primary win, Donald Trump misleads on Democrats voting, immigration, border wall","January 24, 2024",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"Immigration, National, Border Security, Corrections and Updates, Elections","MANCHESTER, N.H. — Former President Donald Trump, who ran a nontraditional campaign in New Hampshire, beat his onetime ally Nikki Haley in the state’s Republican presidential primary. This was not the typical New Hampshire primary. Trump refused to debate his primary rivals for months, skipped the usual events other candidates attended and largely campaigned in front of his fans at large rallies. Haley, a former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador during the Trump administration, also said she would no longer debate unless it was against Trump or President Joe Biden. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who campaigned sporadically in New Hampshire in the days leading up to the Jan. 23 election, dropped out just two days before the contest. Haley congratulated Trump and said she will continue her campaign. ""New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last in the nation,"" she told her supporters. ""This race is far from over."" In a victory speech, Trump misled about New Hampshire’s electoral process, how much border wall he built and the number of migrants crossing the border illegally. Democrats are not allowed to vote in the Republican primary in New Hampshire. They would have had to change their party affiliation on their voter registration in early October to vote in the Jan. 23 primary. Voters registered as ""undeclared"" — New Hampshire’s version of independents — are allowed under state law to vote in the primary. Those voters walk into the polls and can cast a Republican ballot. While some polls showed Haley was leading among undeclared voters, some said they would vote for Trump. The state has more undeclared voters than people registered with the Republican or Democratic parties. Immigration officials have stopped people trying to cross the border about 8 million times during Biden’s presidency, but that doesn’t mean that 8 million people have come in. Because these encounter statistics track events, not individuals, if a person tries coming in three different times, that counts as three stops — even if it’s the same person. Also, millions of stops have led to expulsions and deportations. U.S. Customs and Border Protection publishes data on how many people with criminal convictions or who are wanted by law enforcement are stopped by border authorities. Criminals encountered are not let into the country, ""absent extenuating circumstances,"" according to the agency’s website. We asked multiple immigration experts about this claim in September 2023, and they all said there was no evidence that people were coming to the border from prisons or mental institutions. PolitiFact previously examined a claim from a Republican representative who said Venezuela is sending its prisoners to the southern border and found no public reports or mentions of Venezuela’s government releasing prisoners and sending them to the U.S. Many immigrants arriving at the border turn themselves in to authorities and ask for asylum, which starts a screening process. The Trump administration built 458 total miles of primary and secondary barriers — the first and secondary impediments people encounter as they try to get into the U.S. But the majority of this fencing replaced older, smaller and dilapidated barriers. Trump added about 50 miles of new wall in places where nothing existed, but not hundreds as he says. Trump did win New Hampshire’s primary in 2016, 2020, and 2024. But he has never won the state in a general election. In 2016, Hillary Clinton defeated Trump in New Hampshire, 46.8% to 46.5% — a difference of 2,736 votes. In 2020, Biden’s margin over Trump was wider, 53% to 45%, or 59,277 votes. Since 2016, the results in New Hampshire’s races for president, Senate, and House seats have increasingly favored Democrats. The most recent poll for the 2024 presidential race — from mid-January by Marist College — showed Biden leading Trump by 7 percentage points in a head-to-head contest, and by 3 percentage points if independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was included in the race. PolitiFact Senior Correspondent Louis Jacobson contributed to this report.

Does the New Hampshire primary have a future? Impressions from PolitiFact’s reporting on the ground,"January 23, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"New Hampshire, Elections","MANCHESTER, N.H. — On the surface, this year’s primary has proceeded as usual. Candidates spoke to packed rooms, with the cleverest booking spaces just smaller than the expected turnout to stoke the excitement. Presidential candidates dropped by the Red Arrow Diner here, including former President Donald Trump and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. The media descended on Dixville Notch in the far northern part of the state to cover midnight voting. (Haley swept it, winning all six votes.) And local TV stations played a seemingly endless loop of attack ads. Yet the run-up to the Jan. 23 voting also offered signs that New Hampshire is slipping from its long-standing position as king of the presidential primaries. During three reporting trips to the state — in October, December and January — PolitiFact was not the only media outlet to notice: The Republican front-runner, Trump, came to the state only sporadically, mainly for big rallies and largely eschewing the politicking New Hampshire is famous for, while skipping events that every other candidate attended, such as the First in the Nation Summit in October. Haley, fresh off a disappointing third-place finish in Iowa, rejected a long-planned televised New Hampshire debate, even though the state’s primary was considered a must-win for her. After taking heat for her answer to a question on the Civil War, Haley went for several days without answering questions from New Hampshire voters, who are known for their political knowledge and inquisitiveness. Immediately after the Iowa caucuses, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis bypassed New Hampshire and flew to South Carolina. He ended up holding only a few events in New Hampshire before dropping out of the presidential race two days before the primary. On the Democratic side, the national party, at the urging of President Joe Biden, took away New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation status for his party, handing it instead to South Carolina. This meant New Hampshire, required by law to have the nation’s first Democratic primary, did so Jan. 23, but it did not distribute Democratic delegates. Because of the shake-up, Biden never campaigned in the state, and backers were left to promote a write-in campaign. By Jan. 21, two days before the primary, the GOP field had narrowed to only two major candidates, far fewer than in the past. In the last contested GOP primary in 2016, five candidates won at least double-digit-percentage shares of the vote, and in 2020, five Democrats secured at least 8% of the vote. ""Fewer candidates, fewer events, fewer opportunities for regular citizens to engage with candidates about their real lives — I'm not nostalgic about the past, but I do think the primary as we knew it, that served the nation well for decades, has changed,"" said Fergus Cullen, a former state Republican Party chairman and now a Dover city councilor. ""More than ever (this year), New Hampshire was just a set and voters were extras."" Kathleen Sullivan, a longtime Democratic activist in Manchester, agreed. ""It’s like watching bowling pins fall. There is not that much excitement and energy."" St. Anselm College, which was supposed to host a debate until Haley canceled, ""was as dead as a doornail"" over the final weekend before voting, Sullivan said. Keri Thompson, who teaches at Emerson College and regularly travels to early caucus and primary states with her students, called the vibe this year in New Hampshire ""disappointing."" ""I’ve been in New Hampshire with students the last few election cycles and it’s been a lot more exciting,"" Thompson said at a Haley rally at a high school in Exeter. ""It feels very tame."" The Red Arrow Diner in Manchester, New Hampshire, has been a traditional stop for politicians to meet voters before the state’s primary. (Matthew Crowley/PolitiFact) New Hampshire voters noticed, too. ""I blame Trump for this,"" said Robert McCowen of Hampton Falls after attending a Haley rally in Exeter. ""Trump should have been in on the first debate and going on. Defend your record. To quote — I think it was (former GOP primary candidate) Chris Christie — he is a coward. He will not back up what he did."" At an elementary school voting site in Manchester, voter Scott Gonzales said that although he cast his ballot for Biden in 2020, he was disappointed that the Republican candidates did not debate. A planned Jan. 18 debate hosted by ABC and WMUR, the state’s only local TV station and a PolitiFact partner, was scrapped when Haley said she would debate only Trump or Biden. A planned Jan. 21 CNN debate was also canceled. ""They should be debating,"" Gonzales said. ""If you want to get people’s vote, you should see the differences they have when they talk to each other."" A relic of the 2020 New Hampshire primary in WMUR-TV's green room. The 2024 version will be more sparse. (Louis Jacobson/PolitiFact) Snubbing WMUR was ""a big deal,"" said Michael Graham, managing editor of New Hampshire Journal, a website that covers the primary extensively. ""As the only New Hampshire TV station, it's viewed as the community bulletin board,"" Graham said. ""Plenty of people have the attitude that if it didn't happen on WMUR, it didn't happen."" Other media outlets were left in the cold, too, often facing challenges getting into public events for Haley and other candidates, The Boston Globe reported. PolitiFact attended various candidates’ appearances in Exeter, Hampton, Henniker, Manchester, Peterborough and Rochester in the week leading up to the primary, but our attempts to attend Trump rallies in  Atkinson, Concord, Laconia, Manchester and Rochester were rejected. (We fact-checked Trump anyway, thanks to livestreams.) Democratic presidential candidate Dean Phillips addresses voters at an event in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 18, 2024. (Louis Jacobson/PolitiFact) On the Democratic side, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips — Biden’s long-shot challenger in the Jan. 23 nondelegate-awarding primary — was an unexpected beneficiary of the Republican primary’s dwindling hold on the state. Phillips ""drew a bit of media attention at his campaign events this week because many national reporters were milling around Manchester with nothing else to do,"" Semafor wrote. (We were among the outlets that covered Phillips.) The longer-term question for Democrats is whether the party will give New Hampshire prominence again. Along with the first caucus state, Iowa, New Hampshire has declined in relevance for many Democratic officials because of demographics: Both states have a far greater share of white residents than the nation as a whole, and even more so compared with the Democratic Party’s electorate. A few inches of snow didn't stop New Hampshire residents, but candidates ignoring norms for the First in the Nation primary state irked many voters. (Louis Jacobson/PolitiFact) Fans of the old-school New Hampshire primary look with hope to 2028, when the presidential contest won’t include any incumbents. Early 2028 Democratic contenders, including Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, have made it a point to visit the state, even five years in advance, said Christopher Galdieri, a St. Anselm College political scientist.

"As he seeks immunity, Donald Trump uses flawed logic to compare presidents, police officers","January 23, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"Criminal Justice, Legal Issues","As former President Donald Trump petitions the courts to be held legally immune for his actions as president, he’s begun comparing presidents and police officers. In a Jan.19 Truth Social post, Trump argued that ""a president of the United States must have full immunity, without which it would be impossible for him/her to properly function."" He added that immunity is needed even for ""events that ‘cross the line,’"" though he didn’t specify what he meant. ""You can’t stop police from doing the job of strong & effective crime prevention because you want to guard against the occasional ‘rogue cop’ or ‘bad apple,’"" he wrote in all caps. ""Sometimes you just have to live with ‘great but slightly imperfect.’"" Police officers are protected against lawsuits related to their official actions, called ""qualified immunity."" Without ""complete & total presidential immunity,"" Trump wrote, ""the authority & decisiveness of a president of the United States will be stripped & gone forever."" Trump repeated the argument at a Jan. 20 Manchester, New Hampshire, rally and the following night in Rochester, New Hampshire, shortly before the state’s first-in-the-nation Republican primary. A three-judge federal appeals panel is considering Trump’s immunity request. Regardless of that panel’s decision, the case could go before the U.S. Supreme Court. Legal experts told PolitiFact that whatever the judicial ruling, Trump’s suggestion that he’s seeking what police officers already have is flawed. ""What Trump seeks goes far beyond"" the protections police officers have, said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor. Trump’s campaign did not answer an inquiry for this article. The legal protection that police officers and other government officials are afforded is known as ""qualified immunity."" It is intended to protect officers conducting official duties not only from being held financially liable for their actions but also from being forced to face trial over those actions. But as the ""qualified"" denotes, this type of immunity is not all-encompassing for key reasons: It applies to civil cases, not criminal charges. ""It has nothing to do with criminal liability,"" said Joanna C. Schwartz, a UCLA law professor. If officers are charged with a crime, as happened with the officers in the 2020 death of Minneapolis resident George Floyd, they can stand trial. In civil cases, accused officers have to invoke qualified immunity as a defense, and the judge may or may not grant them protection. The accused officer can still be pursued in a civil lawsuit if the judge decides that that officer acted incompetently or knowingly violated the law. ""If an action is deemed in direct violation of constitutional rights or illegal as known and understood by a reasonable person, qualified immunity would generally not apply,"" said Jillian E. Snider, a retired New York City police officer and a lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Schwartz said the qualified immunity defense ""is very strong, but it is not insurmountable."" Trump’s lawyers have said in court that they are seeking much broader immunity than what police officers receive. Trump ""seeks full immunity, not just ‘qualified’ immunity,"" Somin said. ""And he is seeking immunity for criminal conduct, not just civil violations."" During oral arguments Jan. 9 before the three-judge federal panel, one judge asked Trump’s attorney, D. John Sauer, whether the president should, hypothetically, be immune from prosecution for ordering U.S. Navy commandos to assassinate a political rival. Sauer said that unless the president had been impeached first, such a prosecution would be invalid. In his rallies and Truth Social post, Trump didn’t mention the caveat about impeachment, saying instead that presidents should have ""complete & total presidential immunity.’ Even Karen M. Blum, an emeritus professor at Suffolk University Law School and self-described longtime critic of qualified immunity, said that qualified immunity has firmer legal support than what Trump seeks. ""Trump’s argument that no matter what, the president should be immune from any and all liability, civil or criminal, is not supported by any constitutional jurisprudence known to me,"" Blum said."
"DeSantis drops out of 2024 presidential race, Haley and Trump continue their battle in New Hampshire","January 21, 2024",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"Immigration, National, New Hampshire, Economy, Elections","MANCHESTER, N.H. – After a few sporadic campaign events in New Hampshire in the days leading up to the state’s Jan. 23 primary, Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race, saying there was ""no clear path to victory"" for him. DeSantis said he was sticking to his commitment to back the Republican Party’s nominee and endorsed former President Donald Trump’s campaign, saying that the majority of Republican primary voters want to give Trump another chance. ""I have had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci,"" DeSantis said. ""Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden."" In recent days, the DeSantis campaign repeatedly changed his schedule, leaving it unclear whether he would return to New Hampshire or drop out. On Saturday, he alerted the media and supporters that he would hold a meet-and-greet at a Manchester restaurant Sunday evening, only to cancel it a few hours before. Television crews and photographers were beginning to set up at The Farm Bar and Grille restaurant shortly before DeSantis posted his exit video on X, which started with, ""Greetings from Florida."" ""We left it all out on the field,"" DeSantis said Jan. 21. ""If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews I would do it."" DeSantis’ post included an uplifting quote that he attributed to former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" But Churchill didn’t say that, historians say. DeSantis’ dropping out left Trump and his onetime ally and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley as the remaining main Republican candidates seeking to oust President Joe Biden from office. Haley, after hearing the news about DeSantis dropping out, told supporters at a campaign event that DeSantis had been a ""good governor,"" and said the race is now ""one fella and one lady left."" ""Do you want more of the same or do you want something new?"" she said. Trump spent the last few days before New Hampshire’s election in front of thousands of loyal fans at boisterous rallies across the state and generally ignoring local media. Haley sought to persuade voters at smaller events. They should ditch the ""chaos"" of Trump, she told media outlets, and put her, a younger person with business bookkeeping experience, in the White House.  Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump gesturing to the crowd Jan. 20, 2024, after speaking during a campaign event in Manchester, N.H. (AP) As the polling front-runner, Trump dedicated his attention to friendly and loyal fans who ignored frigid temperatures and crowded into his rallies across the state. Hundreds of Trump supporters started to line up more than five hours before his rally in Manchester, standing outdoors in single-digit-degree weather while vendors hawked MAGA T-shirts and hats. He skipped an invite from WMUR-TV, the local ABC affiliate and PolitiFact partner, to take questions during their Sunday ""Closeup"" morning show. Haley appeared on the show and answered policy questions related to taxes and Social Security. Trump’s rallies serve dual purposes: attack his primary rivals, Democrats and Biden while entertaining his supporters. Trump at his rallies repeated many inaccurate and misleading talking points about his own electoral record and his rivals’ stance on border security and Social Security retirement age eligibility.

(Louis Jacobson/PolitiFact) Haley’s more low-key events aimed to win support from Republican and undeclared voters, many who were listening to her stump speech for the first time. ""How many of you are hearing me for the first time?"" Haley asked voters in Peterborough, New Hampshire. ""All of you. Well, it's great to see you. I'm glad you're here."" Haley has focused on in-person events in New Hampshire after forgoing New Hampshire debates scheduled by WMUR and CNN. During her speeches in cities and small towns across the Granite State, Haley paints a picture of a country in disarray, and her leadership as its hope for success. ""It's a tough time right now in the country,"" Haley said in Peterborough before sharing grim statistics about students’ low proficiency in math and reading, illegal border crossings under Biden and fentanyl’s dangers. One voter at Haley’s Peterborough rally told PolitiFact that she wanted Haley to win the primary, but would back Trump if Haley didn’t succeed.

"Fact-checking Haley’s New Hampshire claims on fentanyl, education, Trump’s stance on retirement age","January 21, 2024",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"National, Border Security, Drugs, Education, Social Security","PETERBOROUGH, N.H.: On her 52nd birthday, Republican presidential primary candidate Nikki Haley called out former President Donald Trump on his age and for confusing her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Haley told supporters at the Monadnock Center for History and Culture that during a Jan. 19 rally, Trump, 77, blamed her for failing to secure the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. ""He went on and talked about how I kept the police from going into the Capitol on Jan. 6, went on and repeated that I didn't do anything to secure the Capitol. Let's be clear,"" Haley said. ""I wasn't in the Capitol on Jan. 6. I wasn’t in office on Jan. 6. He mentioned it three times, he got confused."" PolitiFact has fact-checked multiple misleading claims about Pelosi’s role regarding Capitol security on Jan. 6 and have found that this responsibility is shared, it is not solely the responsibility of the Speaker. At her Peterborough rally, Haley also repeated many claims we’ve previously fact-checked, including statistics about illegal immigration and fentanyl seizures. One voter PolitiFact spoke to outside the event told us she valued accuracy and wanted to know the context behind claims she often hears from candidates, including Haley. Here are some of the statistics Haley cited, along with context. There’s no way to know how much fentanyl crossed the border into the U.S. But, we do know how much fentanyl was stopped from getting into the country — 27,000 pounds in fiscal year 2023, which ended Sept. 30. Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid up to 100 times more potent than morphine. Its potency is what makes it so lethal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be deadly for an adult. That means border officials seized more than enough fentanyl to kill every American (the estimated U.S. population is more than 333 million). Yet, fentanyl’s lethality can vary based on its purity and a person’s height, weight and tolerance from past exposure, Timothy J. Pifer, director of the New Hampshire State Police Forensic Laboratory, told PolitiFact in 2019. Also, just because enough fentanyl has been seized to kill every American does not mean every American has the same chance of dying of a fentanyl overdose, Dr. Andrew Stolbach, a toxicologist and emergency doctor at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, previously told us. ""That would assume that all that drug was somehow going to get into everybody,"" Stolbach said. We rated a similar claim Mostly True. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collects data on the leading causes of death nationwide, but it doesn’t keep tabs on which drugs cause the most fatalities. Instead, fentanyl deaths fall under the broader category of ""other synthetic narcotics,"" Brian Tsai, a spokesperson with the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics Public Affairs Office told PolitiFact in April. Fentanyl comprises about 90% of the deaths in that narcotics category, Tsai said. For the 18 to 45 age group, Tsai said, the leading cause of death was ""accidents (unintentional injuries)."" Within the several subcategories under ""unintentional injuries,"" ""unintentional drug overdoses,"" is the largest proportion, and ""synthetic narcotics,"" is the No. 1 category. Medical experts previously told PolitiFact that although the statistic is likely right, data collection limitations make it difficult to know with certainty. Haley’s statistics are accurate. To compare test scores among the states, researchers and politicians typically point to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which tests public school students’ progress in a variety of subjects, including English and math. The national tests focus on certain grade levels and are administered every other year. In 2022, 31% of eighth grade students performed at or above the  NAEP proficient level on the reading assessment, which was 3 percentage points lower compared with 2019, the previous assessment year. In 2022, the percentage of eighth-grade students performing at or above the NAEP proficient level in mathematics was 26% . Martin West, an education professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, told Education Week in October 2022 that fourth and eighth grade reading and math NAEP scores ""are down substantially."" ""And they are down nearly everywhere: Every state (and the District of Columbia) saw scores drop by a statistically significant amount on at least one of the four tests administered this spring,"" said West, a member of the National Assessment Governing Board, which oversees NAEP. Proficient on NAEP does not mean grade level performance — it's significantly above that. ""Using NAEP’s proficient level as a basis for education policy is a bad idea."" Haley omits that Trump said this decades ago and this has not been his position for years. Trump co-wrote the book ""The America We Deserve,"" which was published in January 2000 as he considered a bid for president as a Reform Party candidate. Weeks later, Trump said he wouldn’t run, declaring the Reform Party a ""total mess."" Fiscal responsibility was one of the book’s themes, and Trump warned that the Social Security trust fund would run out by 2030. (More than two decades later, the expected depletion date is around 2034, barring congressional action.) ""We can also raise the age for receipt of full Social Security benefits to seventy. This proposal would not include anyone who is currently retired or about to retire,"" the book said. Trump wrote: ""A firm limit at age seventy makes sense for people now under forty. We’re living longer. We’re working longer. New medicines are extending healthy human life.""

"Did the world know about global warming a century ago, as Dean Phillips said?","January 21, 2024",Louis Jacobson,"New Hampshire, Climate Change, Elections, Science","MANCHESTER, N.H. — Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., has been campaigning aggressively in New Hampshire, hoping to convince Democratic voters that a new face is needed to keep the party in control of the White House in 2024. In a series of events in the state on Jan. 18, Phillips, who is challenging incumbent Joe Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination, traveled with entrepreneur and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate-turned-independent Andrew Yang. The two discussed the promise, and potential pitfalls, of artificial intelligence. In a packed room at the University of New Hampshire, Manchester, Phillips said AI ""can be beautiful, but it also has great risks. It's going to disenfranchise this economy. It's going to be disruptive in ways that we can actually anticipate."" Philips compared relative inaction on AI policy now with inaction on climate change a century ago. ""We had 100 years to prepare for climate change,"" Phillips said. ""We knew 100 years ago what would happen by burning fossil fuels."" PolitiFact checked with several academics who have studied the history of climate change science and found that the reality was not so clear cut. ""In principle, the effects of burning fossil fuels were known"" by a century ago, ""but this was not widely known or recognized,"" said Ben Lieberman, a historian at Fitchburg State University and co-author of ""Climate Change in Human History: Prehistory to the Present."" Only later in the 20th century did this knowledge begin to amass, Lieberman said. The first inklings in the scientific community emerged in the 1850s, said John Brooke, an emeritus professor of history at Ohio State University and author of ""Climate Change and the Course of Global History: A Rough Journey."" Then, in 1896, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius wrote a paper explaining how industrial carbon dioxide emissions could spur a warming trend that would become known as the greenhouse effect. So, in theory, the world has had more than a century to prepare for significant climate change, said Joshua P. Howe, an associate professor of history and environmental studies at Reed College and author of ""Behind the Curve: Science and the Politics of Global Warming."" ""There was a lot that was still unknown, but if the sentiment was that we have known about this at least in broad terms for a long time, that's right,"" Howe said. However, other historians cautioned that it took more time for this knowledge to coalesce and gain wide acceptance. ""Understanding the earth's heat budget and infrared radiation was in its infancy,"" said James R. Fleming, an emeritus professor of science, technology and society at Colby College and author of ""Fixing the Sky: The Checkered History of Weather and Climate Control."" ""This was pre-computer, and hypothetical,"" Brooke said. Even after another scientist, Guy Stewart Callendar of England, echoed Arrhenius’ argument in the late 1930s, ""he was ignored, because warming was not yet an obvious problem,"" Brooke said. By the 1950s, hard evidence linking carbon burning to climate began to amass, with Charles David Keeling’s measurements of carbon dioxide levels at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii. (Keeling’s students included Al Gore, the future vice president, Democratic presidential nominee and climate change campaigner.) Climate change merited a mention in President Lyndon Johnson’s policy agenda in 1965. Nevertheless, it took years for the complicated interactions of atmospheric carbon dioxide to increase global temperatures notably.  Only when the temperature climb accelerated in earnest in the 1970s did scientists and policymakers began paying serious attention, experts said.
